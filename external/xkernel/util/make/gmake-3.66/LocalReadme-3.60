* ftp'd from ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu.  Good old GNU is into documentation that
eats up trees like nobody's business--the file make.dvi.small is a version
of the documentation in 10pt with closer spacing, and takes up 70+ pages
rather than 120+.  A modified texinfo.tex to generate this is in
opt:~pab/Tex/Macros; you shouldn't need it, though.  BTW, the reason it's
not other readable is that it doesn't have the GNU license in it--ask me if
you want it, so I can caution you about the legal ramifications and avoid
lawsuits :-).

* Sun 4 compilation: Changed instname to gnumake.  Installing in
/usr/local/new.  Makefile copied to Makefile.Sun4

* Sequent compilation: Changed instname to gnumake.  Installing in
/usr/local/new.  Makefile copied to Makefile.Sequent.

* Disabled load average reading in all versions--we'll not install this
thing setgid kmem.  Commented out the commands for this in the install rule.

* Changed default value for -j flag to match system makes on systems: 3 for
Caslon (def SEQUENT), 4 for Vochelle (def VOCHELLE).  Set it to 1 for all
other systems to limit system overload on uniprocessors.

* gnumake installed on optima as /usr/local/new/gnumake

* gnumake installed on caslon as /usr/local/new/gnumake

* Pulled alloca.c from emacs 18.55 source for Vochelle.  Redefined D_NAMLEN
for Vochelle, which doesn't have a d_namlen field in dirent (glob/glob.c).
Added cast in line 487 of glob.c for alloca (illegal pointer combination).
Making libglob.a fails; no ranlib in Irix.  This is a benign error.

* gnumake installed on vochelle as /usr/local/new/gnumake

* Removed source; this version was never officially installed, and is now
superseded by version 3.62.
