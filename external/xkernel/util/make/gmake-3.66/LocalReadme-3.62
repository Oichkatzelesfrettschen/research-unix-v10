We need this to build the gnu c library.  ftp'd source and doc tar files
from prep.ai.mit.edu.  Modified Makefile for Sun4, compiled, and stored into
/usr/local/gnu-2.0 with symlink to it in /usr/local/new, under name
"gnumake".  Disabled load averaging, so gnumake is not installed setgid
kmem.

Build on Vochelle.  Makefile is in Makefile.mips-irix.  Changes necessary:
+ Many added defines
+ Conditional compile on MIPSIRIX to prototype open in make.h and arscan.c
  (default conflicted with /usr/include/fcntl.h)
Installed in /usr/local/new as gnumake.  (Why? -j 4 runs 4 compiles in
parallel ;-))

Modified texinfo files to handle version 2.49 of texinfo, and installed info
pages for gnuemacs.

Installed on Sun4s as gmake, in /usr/local.  Modified man page to gmake.man
to reflect local name; install by hand.  Remember to strip before
installation.  Installed on Caslon, and Vochelle.  Vochelle man page in
/usr/man/local/man1.

* Thu Dec 31 10:32:43 1992
Known bug on Caslon: The default command for .c.o includes -o $*.o; Dynix's
cc croaks on this, thinking it will overwrite the output file it wants to
create ($*.o).  Workaround:  Redefine OUTPUT_OPTION="" on command line.

Attempt build for Solaris.  Define USG, POSIX, HAVE_DUP2, SOLARIS.  Patched
main.c circa #347 to use standard setvbuf for SOLARIS, instead of swapping
second and third arguments.  Installed; manpage in
/usr/local/man/man1/gmake.1.
