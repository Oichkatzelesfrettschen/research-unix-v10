# The normal non-library build procedure depends on a protocol having
# the same name as its source directory.  If there are protocols,
# drivers or apis which are actually defined in a different directory,
# their FILES and LIBS variables should be remapped here.  
#
# E.g., the protocol SRX is built from source code in a directory
# named machnetipc.  The build procedure will define the variables
# machnetipc_FILES and machnetipc_LIBS, but the remapping of srx_FILES
# and srx_LIBS would need to be made in the appropriate ComposeHacks
# directory: 
#
#	srx_FILES = $(machnetipc_FILES)
#	srx_LIBS = $(machnetipc_LIBS)

machripc_FILES = $(netipc_FILES)
machripc_LIBS = $(netipc_LIBS)

lproxy_FILES = $(proxy_FILES)
uproxy_FILES = $(proxy_FILES)
lproxy_LIBS = $(proxy_LIBS)
uproxy_LIBS = $(proxy_LIBS)

xksocket_LIBS = $(socket_LIBS)
xksocket_FILES = $(socket_FILES)
