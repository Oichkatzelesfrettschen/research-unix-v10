			     x-kernel v3.2

Documentation is in the 'doc' directory.  Information on installing
the x-kernel is in a section of the xkernel Programmer's manual in
doc/manual/manual.{dvi,ps} or in doc/manual/install.tex.  


			 Directory structure

bin -- Binaries for utility programs used to develop new kernels.

build -- Template makefiles and configuration files for
building x-kernels.

doc -- Documentation.

etc -- Configuration-related data files and protocol tables. 

mach3 -- Sources and binaries for the Mach3-based x-kernel.

pi -- Sources and binaries for platform independent code: the
x-kernel's object-oriented infrastructure, protocol table code, and
the message, participant, and map libraries.

protocols -- Sources and binaries for all protocols supported 
in this release.

sunos -- Sources and binaries for Unix-based $x$-kernel.

util -- Utility programs for the x-kernel.


Each of the platform directories (mach3, sunos) has the following
substructure: 

PLATFORM/drivers -- device drivers for this platform
PLATFORM/api -- application programmer interfaces for this platform
PLATFORM/user -- user libraries for interfacing with the x-kernel APIs
PLATFORM/pxk -- threads, allocators, and other platform-specific code


There are additional subdirectories supporting the mach3 in-kernel
platform: 

mach3/machkernel -- This hierarchy's structure parallels that of the
mach kernel source tree and contains modifications made to support the
x-kernel.  

mach3/inkernel -- Supplements to mach3/pxk for the in-kernel
version.
