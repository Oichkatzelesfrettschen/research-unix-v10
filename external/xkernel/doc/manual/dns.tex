\section{Host Name Service}
\label{dns}
A simple way of mapping host name strings to host IP addresses is
provided via rom file entries (see section \ref{romfile}) and the interface
function {\em xk\_gethostbyname}.

During $x$-kernel startup, rom file lines beginning with
the string ``dns'' are parsed into name and address components
and added to the host name table.  E.g., 

\begin{verbatim}
dns umbra 192.12.69.97
\end{verbatim}

The host name must be less than 64 characters in length.

\subsection{Operations}
\subsubsection{xk\_gethostbyname}

This function will look up a hostname and return its IP address in
storage provided with the call.
The name must be an exact match to a rom file entry, NB no substrings
are allowed.  If the name is not found, the return code indicates
failure.

{\sem xkern\_return\_t} {\bold xk\_gethostbyname} ({\sem char} *{\caps name}, 
{\sem IPhost} *{\caps addr} );
