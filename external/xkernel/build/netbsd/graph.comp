# This is an example graph.comp file.  It is provided as an
# illustration of the structure of graph.comp files.  You will not be
# able to immediately build a kernel from this graph.comp without
# setting up a specialized build environment.  Simpler example
# graph.comps that should work "right out of the box" are contained in
# this directory under the names graph.comp.{mach3,sunos,...}. 
# 
#
# graph.comp is divided into three sections, delimited by the
# character '@'.  Protocols listed in the first section are 'driver'
# protocols.   (The first section is empty in this file.)
#

#
# Non-driver protocols are declared in the second section

# This is an example of multiple instantiation.  In this example,
