#
# This is an example rom file for the sunos platform.  When running
# a test between two simulated hosts, you will need a rom file for each
# simulated host.  The two sunos rom files in this directory can be used
# for such a test, though they must be edited for your specific
# configuration. 
#

#
# The SIMETH line identifies the UDP port that this simulated host
# should use to simulate an ethernet device.

simeth 	9876

#
# The ARP lines specify the binding between the simulated hosts and
# the real hosts/real UDP port pairs.  You will need to edit the 
# "Real IP address" field of each line to reflect the real IP host on
# which you intend to run your xkernel.  The real IP addresses can be
# the same host or different hosts -- it is sufficient that the
# combination of Real-IP-address/Real-UDP-port-number is unique for 
# each simulated host.
#
# One of the real port numbers should correspond to the port number in
# the preceding SIMETH line.
