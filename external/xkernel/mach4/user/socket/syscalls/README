This directory contains the assembly code interface to some system calls.
The system calls are renamed by prefixing them with "sc_".  This makes
it possible to implement additional stuff in the original function,
calling the actual system call only if necessary.

This assembly code is specific to the DECstation 5000 (mips) platform.
It should be possible to port the socket code to other platforms by
writing analogous system call interface code for those platforms.
