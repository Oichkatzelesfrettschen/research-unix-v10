Research UNIX V10 Licensing Overview
===================================

This repository aggregates portions of the Tenth Edition Research UNIX
source tree.  Redistribution terms for much of this code remain tied to
AT&T Bell Labs' original non‑commercial license.  See `COPYING.pdf` for the
full text of that notice.

Additional directories contain software released under other well‑known
open source licenses, including the BSD, MIT and GNU GPL families.  Each
file retains its own license header where available.  A few components
may carry different terms; consult `licenses.csv` for per‑file details.

Unless a file explicitly says otherwise, this material is **not** covered
by the Caldera "Ancient UNIX" license.  Please read the source headers and
`LICENSE` for further guidance before redistributing any part of V10.
