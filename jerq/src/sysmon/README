In addition to the sources for sysmon, this directory includes two
test programs:
	testfrom.c	- tests the from line recognition code
	smtest.c	- tests the mail monitoring code

netnews -n comet -i vismon
New vismon shipped.  The option '-m name' makes it look at
mail for name instead of your login.
