A new version of Brush has been installed.

New features:

Current brush and shade indicators.

Two new operations have been added to the "image" menu:

	outline replaces the current image with its outline.
	shadow draws a shadow behind the current image.

There is now a "curves" operator on the main menu, which will draw splines.

Mouse response while drawing has been improved, so drawing is faster and
more accurate.

Questions, comments, etc. to alice!garry.
