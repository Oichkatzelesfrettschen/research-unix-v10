This is the host part of ped. When invoked it downloads the
5620 (or Blit) module to the terminal and establishes communications.
It is known to have run successfully both on VAXes and 3B-20's.
The installer should be somebody who has a good understanding of
UNIX, the C language, and the 5620/Blit. It is best that he/she be the
systems administrator of your machine. 

The only file that needs special attention is Unix.h. When
running on Unix V, change the first line of the file accordingly.
The current setup reflects the state at MH Bell Labs (running
under research Unix, 8th edition) and at PY Bell labs (running
Unix V) where the specific directories are those convenient to
Bob Hutchsison. Given the diversity of new sites I list below
the meaning of the entries in Unix.h. You should modify the
file by replacing the definitions with whatever is applicable in
your installation.

LOAD_32X 5620 loader (WE32000 processor)
LOAD_68X Blit loader (Motorola 68000 procesor)

PED_5620M the 5620 ped module
PED_blitM the Blit ped module

ZED_5620M obsolete
ZED_blitM obsolete

DOC_LIB prefix of on-line documentation file names

FNT_5620 prefix of file of Bold font for the 5620
TFNT_5620 directory of fonts for the 5620
FNT_blit prefix of file of Bold font for the Blit
TFNT_blit directory of fonts for the Blit

PRIV_PED the private 5620 ped module
PRIV_LIB prefix of documentation names for private version

The program looks for two shell env. variables:
	TERM (it knows 5620, DMD, and dmd as synonims) and
	PEDOPTS (private or public)
Setting PEDOPT=privat, makes ped use th PRIV options from Unix.h.
In that case it also creates a diagnostic file name REC.
