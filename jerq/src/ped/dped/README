This is the 5620 ped part.
It is  supposed to be identical to the Blit (prototype 5620) part except
for the device.h file. The differences are of importance in where
to look for the include files (jped.h) and the memory allocation (jsub.c)

All files that are to be used under the Unix V system must be passed
through the following sed script suggested by
Bob Hutchison (pyuxvv!hutch, PY-2678):

sed '
s/button/bttn/
s/jerq/DMD/
s/index(/strchr(/
s/Texture /Texture16 /g
s/blitblt/bitmapc/
s/texture(/texture16(/' $1 | sed s/blit/jerq/ 

Users on other systems must also modify the makefile. Bob suggests
	CC=dmdcc
	CFLAGS=-O
