		WISH LIST FOR XCIP

(2.3) Correct movement of objects on reading and writing cycles.

(2.3) Global setting of justification and style.

* Changing size of macros.

* Connecting objects.

(2.3) Make bounding boxes grow to fit grid points.

* Allow execution of unix commands - pwd and lf.

* Parm on xcip to specify fonts to be donwloaded initially.

* Make buttons usage more consistent - button 1 to leave, not confirmation.
  When getfile button 3 is confirm, button 1 is leave.  Same in spline.

(2.3) Ask for confirmation on getfile if something on screen.

* Use ICON for get and put.

(2.3) Generalize fonts to allow constant width fonts.

(2.3) Start object selection with macro just created.

* Bug:  reverse bits, make small window, make big again.

(2.3) Bug: prevent user from setting very large point size.

* Accept pic macros with parmeters.

* Support different thickness of lines.

* Global option to auto center without asking files read in.

* Speed up writing out files (especially text string handling).

* Improve spline editing.

* Cut & paste operations on text.

* General undo operation.

* Join text operation - opposite of text separation.

* Last object created if first thing selected. (It is this way for macros.)

* Accept parameters on xcip command to initialize global defaults,
  download fonts, expand window & read in file.

* Fill shapes

(2.4) Text printed a bit higher than displayed in (x)cip.

* Problems with arcs - selecting and i/o if off page.

(2.5) Don't delete the text string right away if it becomes empty while
  editing.

* Prevent objects from being placed off screen (on get file too).

* Support pictures bigger than screen (in pic too).

(2.5) Odd segment number splines not read in correctly.

* Ability to read in a file of many macros and query for
  a macro name to print at a given location (bounding boxes
  determine size). (From Jim Davis)

* Ability to change "row" and "col" sizes (on the fly)
  to change the overall dimensions of the diagram (assuming that
  macros size themselves relative to row and col. (From Jim Davis)

* Generate macros and save them with a given name (if you want to, optional).
  (From Jim Davis)

(2.5) Xspline does not handle splines on IBM.


		WISH LIST FOR JPIC
