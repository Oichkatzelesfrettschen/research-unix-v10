Quick Bubble Manual (2/86)
==========================

input:
the input format expected by the program is a sequence
of lines one for each atom to be shown (max 2000).
each line consists of an upper case letter (any letter except 'X')
to be used as a unique label for the atom (O - oxygen, H - hydrogen, etc)
followed by 4 real numbers, specifying resp. the x, y, and z
coordinates and the radius of the atom, all in Angstrom.
don't reuse labels for atoms with different radii
don't use labels consisting of more than 1 upper case letter.
as an example, the line:
H 10.0 10.0 0.0 0.40
describes a sphere of radius 0.4 Angstrom, labeled 'H', positioned
at (10,10,0).
some example radii for atoms are: H - 0.4, C - 0.77, O - 1.4, N - 1.5, P - 1.9

display:
the number (x,yz) in the upper left hand of the window
shows the current rotation of the molecule, compared to the
initial position read: x gives the degrees of rotation on the
x-axis etc.
the window also displays an X and Y axis along the top and left hand side
of the window. each tick mark corresponds to a distance of 1 Angstrom.

button 1
clicking button 1 at a sphere will make it flash
the program will wait for a second sphere to be selected
and will print the 3D distance in Angstrom between the two in the
upper left hand corner of the window

button 2
clicking button 2 restores the display to the last frame
created (useful, for instance, after using "playback")

button 3
button 3 has a menu with a number of options to be explained below
("->" means a the menu selection is continued in a secondary menu)

	rotate  ->	(rotate molecule on x, y, or z axis
			'angle' increments/decrements step size of rotation
			rotate forwards or backwards
			stop rotation with button 3)
			('reset' restores the display to the original
			angle of rotation (0,0,0))
	playback ->	(play back the last frames seen
			(# frames depends on the size of current window
			make it larger by creating a smaller window)
			either `repeat', `loop' or `step'
			through the sequence (step on button 1 and 2))
	layout  ->
		bubbles/bonds	(display atoms as spheres or as symbols with bonds)
		shadows		(show atoms with neg. z as black disc - on/off)
		mask		(hide/show various groups of atoms in the molecule)
	scale ->
		center		(places the molecule at center of current window)
		move		(gives bullseye cursor
				 put cursor in center of the molecule
				 at the current location, push button 3
				 move cursor to new location, release button 3)
		window size	(scale molecule to the size of the window)
		larger/smaller	(enlarge or reduce the molecule)

	exit		confirm exit with a second click on button 3
