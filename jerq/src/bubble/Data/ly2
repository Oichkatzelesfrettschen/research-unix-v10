Gerard-

Is it possible to get a print-out (black and white) of one
orientation of your heme group?  I have to give a talk for the
Public Relations Department at Short Hills tomorrow, and
would really like to be able to use it (or Z-DNA).

Thanks.

Lynn

p.s. - Denis Rousseau is very impressed.  He mentioned the need to
provide bond connectivities.  It is really easy - you just establish
a rule that if the center of any bubble is less than 2 angstroms (i.e.,
the units that the coordinates are in) from each other, that there is
a bond between the two.

The distance d between the centers of two bubbles if found by taking
the square root of (x1-x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2 + (z1 - z2)**2.
