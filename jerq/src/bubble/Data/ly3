Search for 3CYT 136 in the file you sent me.  This should
be ATOM 4.  Reading across, ATOM 4 is an N (nitrogen),
which belongs to GLY 0 (glycine, which is one of the 20 possible
amino acids), and it is the first amino acid in the structure.`The next three 
numbers (26.266, -12.458, 5.676) are the x, y, and z coordinates
in Angstroms.  I did some calculations and got expected bond lengths.
CA is C-alpha, CB is C-beta, and so forth.

I would be very interested in trying out your new version
of the "bubbles" program.  (By the way, I think you should rename
it something more sexy ... I'll try to think of something.)
