Bill Blumberg has returned with some ideas of what he would
like to do with cytochrome-C.

Meanwhile, Denis Rousseau, who has spent most of his life (other
than the early polywater days!) on heme proteins, has four projects that he wants to do involving hemoglobin.  I gave
him a copy of the index for the tape and he is looking for the
appropriate structures.

I told him to give you a call.  Hope you don't mind.
