INSTALLATION:

Provided is a series of source files, and a makefile.
The makefile is for a stand-alone Blit version, and both a stand-alone
and mux version suitable for the 5620. The Blit version is too large to
run under mux.

To make the version desired
just remove the comment '#'s from the makefile lines of the version required.
do a 'make clean' if another version's .o files are present and do 'make'
or 'make pengo'. No 'make install' is present as different machines would
most probable have the loadable in different place.

The code of pengo itself is awful. It was written in little pieces over
a period of several months. Requests for bug fixes will be accepted, but
general flames as to style and the such can be sent to /dev/null. Constructive
comments as to problems with the code will be read as long as they have
examples of what should be done. So don't just say 'the code at line 30 of
file X is stupid', say rather 'the code at line 30 of file X could be written
as .....' which would remove problem YYYYY.

I would prefer that no local hacking of the code is performed. I will
(occasionally) be working on it when not doing what I should be doing, so
new versions, better end of game stuff and the such will be coming out.
