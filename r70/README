The ../bowell.src file system image is the v10 source
from bowell.  It doesn't have /usr/include.  The r70include.tar
file is a record of what was on r70 (last surviving v10 system
here) as of 3 Sept 1997.  It probably is not precisely concordant
with the earlier bowell source, but should be fairly close.
