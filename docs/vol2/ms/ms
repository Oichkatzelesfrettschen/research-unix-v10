This document describes a set of easy-to-use macros
for preparing documents on
.US .
The macros provide facilities for paragraphs, sections headings (optionally
with automatic numbering), page titles, footnotes,
equations,
tables, two-column format, and
several formats of cover pages for papers.

Introduction.
.R
This memorandum describes a package of commands to produce
papers
using the
.bd I
.I
troff
.R
formatting program.
As with other
formatting
programs,
text is prepared interspersed with formatting commands.
However, this package,
which itself is written in
.I troff
commands,
provides higher-level commands
than those provided with the basic
.I troff
program.
A separate set of macros,
.CW \-mcs ,
produces
an official AT&T style internal document cover sheet.
The
.CW \-mcs
macros automatically invoke the
.CW \-ms
macros.
Although the basic
.CW \-ms
macros work with
.I nroff ,
the
.CW \-mcs
macros do not.
Macro names were selected in
.CW \-mcs
to avoid collisions with
the original
.CW \-ms
macros and thereby maintain backward compatibility.
This document reflects the new macros.
The commands available in this package are listed in
Appendix A; the cover sheet commands and their order are in Appendix B.
.PP
.BI
Text.
.R
Type normally, except that instead of indenting for paragraphs,
place a line reading ``.PP'' before each paragraph.
This will produce indenting and extra space.
.LP
Alternatively, the command .LP that was used here will produce
a left-aligned (block) paragraph.
The paragraph spacing and indent can be changed: see below under ``Registers.''
.PP
.BI
Beginning.
.R
The input should start as follows:
.DS L
	[optional overall format .RP or .TR \- see below]
	.TI
	Title of document (one or more lines)
	.AH "G. R. Emlin" MH 3744 2C-501 research!gre
	.AI
	Author's institution(s)
	.SA
	Abstract; to be placed on the cover sheet of a paper.
	Line length is 5/6 of normal; use .ll here to change.
	.SE  (abstract end)
	.SC 10
	.NH
	Heading (one or more lines)
	.PP
	text ...
.DE
To omit some of the standard headings
(e.g. no abstract, or no author's institution) just
omit the corresponding fields and command lines.
The word
.SM
ABSTRACT
.NL
can be suppressed by writing ``.SA no'' for ``.SA'' or changed to something
else by supplying the replacement as an argument to .SA.
Several interspersed .AH and .AI lines can be used for multiple authors.
The headings are not compulsory: beginning
with a .PP command is perfectly OK and will just
start printing an ordinary paragraph.
.I Warning:
You can't just begin a document with a line of text.
Some
.CW \-ms
command must
precede any text input.  When in doubt, use .LP
to get proper initialization, although any of
the commands .PP, .LP, .TI, .SH, .NH is good enough.
.PP
.BI
Cover Sheets and First Pages.
.R
The first line
of a document may signal the general format of the first page.
In particular, if it is ".RP" a released paper type cover sheet with title and
abstract is prepared.
If it is ".TR", a Computing Science Technical Report format is produced.
If neither .RP nor .TR are present, the .SC triggers an official AT&T
style cover sheet and first page.
The default format, produced if there is no .SC command,
has no cover sheet but puts the title, author information and abstract
on the first page, and
is useful for scanning drafts.
.PP
In general
.CW \-ms
and
.CW \-mcs
are arranged so that only one form
of a document need be stored, containing all
information;  the first command gives the format,
and unnecessary items for that format are ignored.
The full set of commands to produce an official cover sheet is listed
in order in Appendix B.
If you would rather let a program generate the
.CW \-mcs
commands for you, you can use
.I docgen .
|reference(latest volume1)
.I Docgen
is an interactive program that ask questions and packages the answers
into the necessary commands to produce a cover sheet.
.PP
Warning: don't put extraneous material
between the .TI and .SE commands.  Processing
of the titling items is
special, and other data placed in them may not behave
as you expect.
Don't forget that some
.CW \-ms
command must precede any input text.
.PP
.BI
Page headings.
.R
The
.CW \-ms
macros, by default, will print a page heading containing
a page number (if greater than 1).
The default page footer is empty.
You can make minor adjustments to the page headings/footings
by redefining the
strings
LH, CH, and RH
which are the left, center and right portions of the page headings,
respectively; and the
strings
LF, CF, and RF,
which are the left, center and right portions of the page footer.
For more complex formats, the user can redefine
the macros PT and BT, which are invoked respectively at the top
and bottom of each page.
The margins (taken from registers HM and FM for the top and bottom
margin respectively) are normally 1 inch; the page header/footer are
in the middle of that space.
If you redefine these macros, you should be careful
not to change parameters such as point size or font
without resetting them to default values.
.PP
.2C
.BI
Multi-column formats.
.R
If you place the command ``.2C'' in your document, the document will
be printed in double column format beginning
at that point.
The command ``.1C'' will go
back to one-column format and also skip to a new page.
The ``.2C'' command is actually a special case of the command
.DS L
	.MC [column width [gutter width]]
.DE
which makes multiple columns with the specified column
and gutter width; as many columns as will fit across the page
are used.
Thus triple, quadruple, ... column pages can be printed.
Whenever the number of columns is changed (except going from
full width to some larger number of columns)
a new page is started.
.PP
.BI
Headings.
.R
There are two commands to produce headings.
If you type
.DS L
	.NH
	type section heading here
	may be several lines
.DE
you will get automatically numbered section headings (1, 2, 3, ...),
in boldface.
For example,
.DS L
    .NH
    Care and Feeding of Department Heads
.DE
produces
.NH
Care and Feeding of Department Heads
.PP
Alternatively,
.DS L
	.SH
	Care and Feeding of Directors
.DE
will print the heading with no number added:
.SH
Care and Feeding of Directors
.PP
Every section heading, of either type, should be followed
by a paragraph beginning with .PP or .LP, indicating
the end of the heading
or another heading command.
Headings may contain more than one line
of text.
.PP
The .NH command also supports more complex numbering schemes.
If a numerical argument is given, it is taken to be a
``level'' number and an appropriate sub-section
number is generated.
Larger level numbers indicate deeper
sub-sections, as in this example:
.DS L
	.NH
	Erie-Lackawanna
	.NH 2
	Morris and Essex Division
	.NH 3
	Gladstone Branch
	.NH 3
	Montclair Branch
	.NH 2
	Boonton Line
.DE
generates:
.br
.ne 2i
.NH
Erie-Lackawanna
.NH 2
Morris and Essex Division
.NH 3
Gladstone Branch
.NH 3
Montclair Branch
.sp
.B
2.2. Boonton Line
.R
.PP
An explicit ``.NH 0'' will reset the numbering of level 1
to one, as here:
.DS L
	.NH 0
	Penn Central
.DE
.ft 3
.if n .ul 1
.sp 1
1.  Penn Central
.PP
.BI
Indented paragraphs.
.R
(Paragraphs with hanging numbers, e.g., references.)
The sequence
.DS L
	.IP [1]
	Text for first paragraph, typed
	normally for as long as you would
	like on as many lines as needed.
	.IP [2]
	Text for second paragraph, ...
.DE
produces
.IP [1]
Text for first paragraph, typed normally for as long
as you would like on as many lines as
needed.
.IP [2]
Text for second paragraph, ...
.LP
A series of indented paragraphs may be followed by an ordinary paragraph
beginning with .PP or .LP,
depending on whether you wish indenting or not.
The command .LP was used here.
.PP
More sophisticated uses of .IP are also possible.
If the label is omitted, for example, a plain block indent
is produced.
.DS L
	.IP
	This material will
	just be turned into a
	block indent suitable for quotations or
	such matter.
	.LP
.DE
will produce
.IP
This material
will just be turned
into a block indent
suitable for
quotations or such matter.
.LP
If a non-standard amount of indenting is required,
it may be specified after the label
and will remain in effect until the next .PP or .LP.
The default dimension of the indent is character positions.
Thus, the general form of the .IP command
contains two additional fields: the label and the indenting
length.  For example,
.DS L
	.IP first: 9
	Notice the longer label, requiring larger
	indenting for these paragraphs.
	.IP second:
	And so forth.
	.LP
.DE
produces this:
.IP first: 9
Notice the longer label, requiring larger
indenting for these paragraphs.
.IP second:
And so forth.
.LP
It is also possible to produce multiple nested indents;
the command .RS indicates that the next .IP starts from the
current indentation level.
Each .RE will eat up one level of indenting
so you should balance .RS and .RE commands.
The .RS command should be thought of as ``move right'' and
the .RE command as ``move left''.
As an example
.DS L
	.IP 1.
	Bell Laboratories
	.RS
	.IP 1.1
	Murray Hill
	.IP 1.2
	Holmdel
	.RS
	.IP 1.2.1
	Red Hill
	.RE
	.IP 1.3
	Whippany
	.RE
	.LP
.DE
will result in
.IP 1.
Bell Laboratories
.RS
.IP 1.1
Murray Hill
.IP 1.2
Holmdel
.RS
.IP 1.2.1
Red Hill
.RE
.IP 1.3
Whippany
.RE
.LP
All of these variations on .LP leave the right
margin untouched.  Sometimes, for purposes
such as setting off a quotation, a paragraph indented
on both right and left is required.
.QP
A single paragraph
like this is obtained
by preceding it with .QP.
More complicated material (several paragraphs) should be
bracketed with .QS and .QE.
.LP
.BI
Emphasis.
.R
To get
italics
say
.DS L
	.I
	as much text as you want
	can be typed here
	.R
.DE
.bd I
.br
as was done for
.I
these three words.
.R
The .R command restores the normal (usually Roman) font.
If only one word is to be italicized, it
may be just given on the line with the .I command,
.br
.bd I 3
.DS
	.I word
.DE
and in this case no .R is needed to restore
the previous font.
A second argument to the .I command is put in the normal font
after to the first argument; a third argument is put in normal font
before the first.
These are usually used to get punctuation to follow or precede the italicized word.
.B
Boldface
.R
can be produced by
.DS L
	.B
	Text to be set in boldface
	goes here
	.R
.DE
Bold text will be underlined on the terminal or line printer.
Arguments to .B behave as those for .I described above.
.BI
Bold italic
.R
is produced with the .BI macro and
.CW
constant width
.R
font with the .CW macro.
The third argument is most useful with .CW.
To say
.CW A ) (
you would type
.DS L
	.CW A ) (
.DE
.PP
The entire font family can be changed with the .FP macro.
So to set the whole document in Palatino you would say
.DS L
	.FP palatino
.DE
Other available font families are: century, helvetica, and times.
Changing the font family does not effect the fonts used for the cover sheet
except in the abstract.
.PP
A few size changes
can be specified with
the commands .LG (make larger), .SM (make smaller), and .NL
(return to normal size).
The size change
is two points; the commands may be repeated for
.SM
increased
.SM
effect
.NL
(here one .NL canceled two .SM commands).
.PP
If actual
.UL underlining
as opposed to italicizing is required,
the command
.DS
	.UL word
.DE
will underline a word.  There is no way to underline
multiple words.
.PP
.BI
Footnotes.
.R
Material placed between lines with the commands .FS
(footnote) and .FE (footnote end) will
be collected, remembered, and finally placed
at the bottom of the current page*.
By default, footnotes are 11/12th the
length of normal text,
but this can be changed using the FL register (see below).
Footnotes are not automatically numbered.
.FS
* Like this.
.FE
.PP
.BI
Displays and Tables.
.R
To prepare displays of lines, such as tables, in which
the lines should not be re-arranged,
enclose them in the commands .DS and .DE
.DS L
	.DS
	table lines, like the
	examples here, are placed
	between .DS and .DE
	.DE
.DE
By default, lines between .DS and .DE are indented and left-adjusted.
\&.DS I is equivalent to plain .DS.
You can also center lines, or retain the left margin.
Lines bracketed by .DS C and .DE commands are
centered individually (and not re-arranged); lines bracketed
by .DS L and .DE are left-adjusted, not indented, and
not re-arranged; lines bracketed by .DS B and .DE are first left-adjusted
then centered as a block.
Thus,
.DS C
these lines were preceded
by .DS C and followed by
a .DE command;
.DE
whereas
.DS L
these lines were preceded
by .DS L and followed by
a .DE command.
.DE
and
.DS B
these lines were preceded
by .DS B and followed by
a .DE command
.DE
Normally a display is kept together, on one page.
If you wish to have a long display which
may be split across page
boundaries,
use .CD, .LD, or .ID in place of
the commands .DS C, .DS L, or .DS I respectively.
An extra argument to the .DS I or .ID command is taken
as an amount to indent.
Note: it is tempting to assume that .DS R will right adjust
lines, but it doesn't work.
.PP
.BI
Programs.
.R
Programs can be displayed using the .P1 and .P2 macros like this:
.P1 3n
#include <stdio.h>
main(){
     printf("hello, world\en");
}
.P2
The amount of indentation may be specified as an argument to .P1
or with number register P1.
.PP
.BI
Equations.
.R
If you have to do Greek or mathematics, see
.I eqn |reference(latest eqn)
for equation setting.
To aid
.I eqn
users,
.CW \-ms
provides definitions of .EQ and .EN
which normally center the equation and set it off slightly.
An argument on .EQ is taken to be an equation
number and placed in the right margin near the equation.
In addition, there are three special arguments to EQ:
the letters C, I, and L indicate centered (default),
indented, and left adjusted equations, respectively. 
If there is both a format argument
and an equation number,
give the format argument first, as in
.bd I
.DS
	.EQ L (1.3a)
.DE
for a left-adjusted equation numbered (1.3a).
.PP
.BI
Tables and Pictures.
.R
Similarly,
the macros .TS and .TE
are defined
to separate tables (see |reference(latest tbl)) from text with a little space.
A very long table with a heading may be broken
across pages by beginning it with .TS H
instead of .TS,
and placing the line .TH in the table data
after the heading.  If the table
has no heading repeated from page to page,
just use the ordinary .TS and .TE macros.
Pictures produced with
.I
pic
.R
are surrounded by the macros .PS and .PE (see |reference(latest pic))
and
.I
grap
.R
graphs are surrounded by .G1 and .G2 (see |reference(latest grap)).
.PP
.BI
Boxing words or lines.
.R
To draw rectangular boxes around words the command
.DS L
	.BX word
.DE
will print
.BX word
as shown.
.sp .05
.B1
Longer pieces of text may be boxed
by enclosing them with .B1 and .B2:
.DS L
	.B1
	text...
	.B2
.DE
as has been done here.
.B2
.PP
.BI
Keeping blocks together.
.R
If you wish to keep a table or other block of lines
together on a page, there are ``keep - release'' commands.
If a block of lines preceded by .KS and followed by .KE does
not fit on the remainder of the current page, it will begin
on a new page.
Lines bracketed by .DS and .DE commands are automatically
kept together this way.
There is also a ``keep floating'' command: if the
block to be kept together is preceded by .KF instead of .KS
and does not fit
on the current page, it will be moved down through the text
until the top of the next page.  Thus, no large blank space
will be introduced in the document.  
.PP
.BI
Troff commands.
.R
Among the useful commands from the basic formatting programs
are the following:
.DS L
	.bp - begin new page.
	.br - ``break'', stop running text
	          from line to line.
	.sp n - insert n blank lines.
	.na - don't adjust right margins.
.DE
.PP
.BI
Date.
.R
To specify a date other than today, say, for example,
.DS L
	.DT May 8, 1945
.DE
In the official cover sheet style, this date is placed on the first page.
In ".RP" or ".TR" formats
it is placed on the cover sheet and nowhere else.
To suppress the date, use .DT with no arguments.
Place this line before the title.
.PP
.BI
Signature line.
.R
You can obtain a signature line by placing
the command .SG in the document.
The authors' names will
be output in place of the .SG line and
a typing identification line with author location, department and
initials will be placed on the left side of the page.
If .SG has an argument, it is used as the typing identification line.
The .SG command is ignored
in released paper format.
.PP
.BI
Registers You Can Change.
.R
Certain of the registers used by
.CW \-ms
can
be altered to change default
settings.
They should be changed with .nr commands,
as with
.DS
	.nr PS 9
.DE
.bd I
to make the default point size 9 point.
If the effect is needed immediately, the
normal
.I
troff
.R
command, .ps 9, should be used
in addition to changing the number register.
.br
.ps 9
.vs 10p
.TS
c0 c1 c1 c

PO	page offset	next page	1\(fm\(fm
HM	top margin	next page	1\(fm\(fm
FM	bottom margin	next page	1\(fm\(fm
.TE
.ps \n(PS
.vs \n(VS
You may also alter
the strings
LH, CH, and RH which are the left, center, and right headings
respectively; and similarly LF, CF, and RF which are strings in the
page footer.
The page number on
output
is taken from register PN, to permit
changing its output style.
For more complicated headers and footers
the macros PT and BT can be redefined, as
explained earlier.
.bd I 3
.PP
.BI
Accents.
.R
To simplify typing certain foreign words,
strings representing common accent marks are defined.
They precede the letter over which the mark
is to appear.
Here are the strings:
.TS
center;
c c6 c c.

.TE
.PP
.BI
Usage.
.R
After your document is prepared and stored on a file,
you can print it on a laser printer with the
command
.P1
troff -mcs file | lp
.P2
The
.CW \-mcs
macros will automatically read in the
.CW \-ms
macros.
In each case, if your document is stored in several files,
just list all the filenames
where we have used ``file''.
If you used
.I docgen
to produce the cover sheet file, your file
will begin with commands to include the macros, so you need only type
.P1
troff file | lp
.P2
If equations, tables, or pictures are used,
.I eqn
and/or
.I tbl
and/or
.I pic
must be invoked as preprocessors, so you might say
.P1 0
tbl file | eqn | troff \-mcs | lp
.P2
If other preprocessors are used with
.I eqn ,
.I eqn
should be the \fBlast\fR preprocessor in the pipeline.
In case of doubt,
.I doctype (1)
will tell you how to run off a paper.
.PP
Whenever you print a paper with an official cover sheet, a time-stamped
electronic version of the cover sheet is sent to ITDS.
When ITDS receives the official paper copy of your document, the electronic version
with the same time-stamp is retrieved and included in the next Mercury
Bulletin.
All other electronic versions are deleted.
