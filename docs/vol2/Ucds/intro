Introduction.
.LP
A design has a logical part and a physical part.
The logical part consists of circuit schematics, generally
supplemented by 
.SM PAL
equations.  The physical part includes board layout and routing.
.LP
A circuit contains
.I chips
each identified by
.I name
(which is arbitrary, and of mnemonic value to the designer) and
.I type
(which is generic, e.g.,
.CW 74LS74 ")."
Schematics can be hierarchical; what appears syntactically as
a chip is in fact an instance of a
.I macro ,
(i.e., another drawing) if the file
.I "type\c"
.CW ".w"
.R
exists.
Real chips have
.I pins ,
each identified by a
.I "pin name"
and
.I "pin number" ","
and a
.I "package type" "."
Pin names and their mapping onto pin numbers are a property of
the chip type; the mapping from pin numbers to physical coordinates
is a property of the package type.
.LP
Pins are connected by
.I nets ","
which have unique
.I "net names"
(assigned by the drawing package if
omitted by the user).  It is an error for a pin to
be connected to more than one net.
Nets such as
.CW VCC
and
.CW GND
generally need different routing algorithms from ordinary nets;
these are called
.I "special-signal nets"
in cases where the distinction is important.
.LP
A
.I board
is a physical mounting for packages.  It is mostly characterized by its
.I "pin holes"
(available for package insertion) and
.I "special-signal pins"
(connected to special-signal nets).  An
.I
.SM I/O
.R
.I connector ","
where signals enter or leave the board, is simply a special case
of a chip.
