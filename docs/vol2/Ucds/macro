Signal Bundles and Macros.
.LP
Consider this buffer between two 8-bit busses:
.PS <fig1.pic
It illustrates several
.I jraw
conventions.  The
.I chip
is indicated by a box; its
.I name
is
.CW buffer ;
its
.I type
is
.CW 74F244 .
These are simply unattached text strings that appear stacked inside the
box.
.I "Pin names"
(e.g.,
.CW D0 )
are strings that appear on the inside edge of the box.
.I Nets
are lines that end on a pin.
.I "Net names"
are strings that are placed on nets.  A trailing
.CW "-"
conventionally indicates an active-low signal.
.LP
Even this trivial example involves repeated patterns.
A much more succint equivalent is:
.PS <fig2.pic
The
.I generator
.CW "x<0:7>"
expands into the ordered list
.CW x0 ,
.CW x1 ,...
.CW x7 .
The
.I pattern
.CW "D?\&"
matches two-character pin names that begin with
.CW D .
(The space of possible names comes from the
.CW .pins
file entry for the chip type.)
The names that match the pattern are
.I "sorted alphabetically"
and put into correspondance with the nets.
.LP
If connected sets of nets and pins do not have the same cardinality,
the smaller set is reused until the larger is exhausted.  Thus in the
example, the
.CW drive-
net gets connected to both
.CW OE0-
and
.CW OE1- ,
as desired.
.LP
Frequently one has a group of chips that will be used or replicated as
a unit.  In such a case it makes sense to define a
.I macro
that may be instantiated as required.  A macro lives in its own file.
Here is an example,
.CW opm.j :
.PS <opm.pic
The dotted box (produced by selecting
.CW macro
in
.I jraw ")"
identifies the circuit as a macro.  Strings outside of this box
(conventionally in upper case) are ``pin names'' visible to the
outside world.  Most names inside the box will be made local to
each instantiation.  Net names beginning with
.CW "/"
are ``globals,'' i.e., they represent the same signal throughout
the design.
.CW "/VCC"
and
.CW "/GND"
are the most common global signals.
.LP
Now we use generators to make several instances of
.CW opm.j :
.PS <opmcall.pic
Sixteen copies of the
.CW opm
circuit are made.  The pattern
.CW "D?\&"
is at a lower, i.e., ``faster running,'' level than
.CW "opm<00:15>" ,
with the effect that all the
.CW D0 "'s"
are connected to
.CW "bd0" ,
all the
.CW D1 "'s"
are connected to
.CW "bd1" ,
etc; similarly, all the
.CW A0 "'s"
are connected to
.CW ba0 .
On the other hand, all the
.CW "CS-" "'s"
are separate:
.CW "opm00/CS-"
(the instance of
.CW CS-
in
.CW opm00 )
is connected to
.CW "ops00-" ,
.CW "opm01/CS-"
is connected to
.CW "ops01-" ,
etc.  The manual entries for
.I cdm
and
.I cdmglob
should be consulted for all the details.
