# POSIX Implementation Roadmap

This document summarizes the multi-phase plan for adding a capability-aware POSIX compatibility layer to the Research UNIX V10 code base. Each phase builds on the previous and introduces new functionality, tests and documentation.  Supplemental historical notes can be found in the `ben-books` collection under `docs/ben-books/`.

## Phase I - Foundation
- Establish a cross-platform build system using Make, CMake or Meson.
- Provide incremental build dependencies and an automated test pipeline.
- Lay out the core library structure (`libposix`) with versioned headers.
- Set up a documentation framework and code examples.

## Phase II - Memory Management
- Create virtual memory abstractions with page protection tracking.
- Implement POSIX memory APIs such as `px_mmap()` and `px_msync()`.
- Develop tests for memory protection and leak detection.

## Phase III - Process Management
- Implement run queue structures and capability-aware process states.
- Provide process control wrappers including `px_waitpid()` and `px_execve()`.
- Begin integrating a preemptive scheduler.

## Phase IV - Inter-Process Communication
- Add signal handling wrappers and a FIFO-based IPC mechanism.
- Supply tests for signal registration and FIFO communication.

## Phase V - File System and I/O
- Design a capability-aware VFS with fine-grained permission checks.
- Provide directory operations (`px_opendir()`, `px_readdir()` and `px_closedir()`).
- Implement atomic file operations and integrity checks.

## Phase VI - Networking
- Introduce socket wrappers that automatically retry on `EINTR`.
- Add IPv4 helper routines and network error handling utilities.

## Phase VII - Threading
- Implement a lightweight, process-based threading model using wrappers for `pthread_create()` and `pthread_join()`.
- Document limitations and best practices for thread safety.

## Phase VIII - Timing and Synchronization
- Provide timer infrastructure via `px_nanosleep()` and `k_nanosleep()`.
- Track per-process timer usage and ensure accuracy.

## Phase IX - Testing Framework
- Build a modular test suite with regression tests and performance benchmarks.
- Include POSIX compliance validation and system stress tests.

## Phase X - Documentation and Deployment
- Produce comprehensive API references and troubleshooting guides.
- Offer example applications demonstrating subsystem usage.
- Automate deployment, monitoring and recovery procedures.

### Design Principles
Across all phases the implementation emphasizes capability-based security, robust error handling and efficient resource management. Buffer overflows and integer errors must be prevented, and all operations validated against the caller's capability set.
