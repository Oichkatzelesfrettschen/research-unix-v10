.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sed
copies the named
.I files
(standard input default) to the standard output,
edited according to a script of commands.
The
.B -f
option causes the script to be taken from file
.IR sfile ;
these options accumulate.
If there is just one
.B -e
option and no
.BR -f 's,
the flag
.B -e
may be omitted.
The
.B -n
option suppresses the default output.
.PP
A script consists of editing commands, one per line,
of the following form:
.IP
[\fIaddress\fR [\f5,\fI address\fR] ] \fIfunction\fR [\fIargument\fR ...]
.PP
In normal operation
.I sed
cyclically copies a line of input into a
.I pattern space
(unless there is something left after
a 
.L D
command),
applies in sequence
all commands whose
.I addresses
select that pattern space,
and at the end of the script copies the pattern space
to the standard output (except under
.BR -n )
and deletes the pattern space.
.PP
An
.I address
is either a decimal number that counts
input lines cumulatively across files, a 
.L $
that
addresses the last line of input, or a context address,
.BI / regular-expression / ,
in the style of
.IR ed (1),
with the added convention that
.L \en
matches a
newline embedded in the pattern space.
.PP
A command line with no addresses selects every pattern space.
.PP
A command line with
one address selects each pattern space that matches the address.
.PP
A command line with
two addresses selects the inclusive range from the first
pattern space that matches the first address through
the next pattern space that matches
the second.
(If the second address is a number less than or equal
to the line number first selected, only one
line is selected.)
Thereafter the process is repeated, looking again for the
first address.
.PP
Editing commands can be applied to non-selected pattern
spaces by use of the negation function 
.L !
(below).
.PP
In the following list of functions the
maximum number of permissible addresses
for each function is indicated in parentheses.
.PP
An argument denoted
.I text
consists of one or more lines,
all but the last of which end with 
.L \e
to hide the
newline.
Backslashes in text are treated like backslashes
in the replacement string of an 
.L s
command,
and may be used to protect initial blanks and tabs
against the stripping that is done on
every script line.
.PP
An argument denoted
.I rfile
or
.I wfile
must terminate the command
line and must be preceded by exactly one blank.
Each
.I wfile
is created before processing begins.
There can be at most 120 distinct
.I wfile
arguments.

on the standard output.
.TP
.RB (2) \|n
Copy the pattern space to the standard output.
Replace the pattern space with the next line of input.
.TP
.RB (2) \|N

with an embedded newline.
(The current line number changes.)
.TP
.RB (2) \|p

Quit.
Branch to the end of the script.
Do not start a new cycle.
.HP
.RB (2) \|r 
.I rfile
.br

the next input line.
.TP
.RB (2) \|s/\fIregular-expression\fP/\fIreplacement\fP/\fIflags
Substitute the
.I replacement
string for instances of the
.I regular-expression
in the pattern space.
Any character may be used instead of 
.LR / .
For a fuller description see
.IR ed (1);
although unlike
.I ed ,
the trailing
.B /
.I must
be supplied.
.I Flags
is zero or more of
.RS
.TP
.B g
Global.
Substitute for all non-overlapping instances of the
.I regular expression
rather than just the
first one.

.RE
.HP

.br

command bearing the

.LR t .
If
.I label
is empty, branch to the end of the script.
