.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I fizz
suite of programs handle all the physical aspects of creating a
wire-wrap, buried micro-via or microwire board.
All the programs take
.IR fizz (10.5)
input;
.IR cdl (10.5)
can be converted with
.IR "fizz cvt" .
.PP
All of the programs can take multiple files;
most of the programs require that the files form a board description.
Normally, this is arranged amongst four files (with recommended suffix):
the board and special signal layout
.RB ( .brd ),
the chip, chip type and net descriptions (from
.IR cdmglob (10.1))
.RB ( .wx ),
the package descriptions
.RB ( .pkg ),
and the chip positions
.RB ( .pos ).
In general, if the file arguments are missing, standard input is used.
.PP
.I Fizz artwork
prints various artwork information for the board definition in
.IR files .
The options are
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B -a
prints XY mask clump includes for all placed chips with artwork
fields in their package definitions.
.TP
.B -r
prints bounding rectangle information for the microwire router.
.TP
.B -s
generate silk screen information for chip layout.
.PP
.I Fizz check
checks the syntax and consistency of the given
.IR files .
The
.B -u
option causes the names of any unplaced chips to be printed.
.B -w
checks readiness for wrapping.
Specifically, it checks that no net is too large;
no chip pin coincides with an inappropriate special signal pin,
and no chip pin appears on more than one signal.
Option
.BI -c chip
prints out detailed information about the named chip.
.PP
Clips are simply pins on a wirewrap board.
Almost always they are directly connected to a signal plane.
Clips do not exist in the rest of the
.I fizz
system; they are simply special signal pins.
.PP
.I Fizz clip
takes a board description (in
.IR files )
and a clip description file
.RI ( clipfile )
and checks that all of and only the clips specified are present.
Standard input is used if there are no file arguments.
The output reports missing clips in a format suitable as part of a board description.
The clipfile consists of directives (one per line) of the forms
.ti 17n
.RB [ ssig | pin ]
.I numbers
.RB [ chip | type ]
.I identifiers
.br
.ti 17n
.B tt
.RB [ chip | type ]
.I identifiers
.PP
Clips are put on either specific chips with the given names
.RB ( chip )
or chips of specified chip types
.RB ( type ).
The clips are put on either the specified pins
.RB ( pin )
or pins belonging to the specified special signals
.RB ( ssig ).
The identifier
.B ALL
refers to all chips or types.
Lines starting with a
.B %
are ignored.
The
.B tt
directive means pins whose entry in the
.B tt
field of the type (or the chip's type) is one of
.BR GVWXYZ .
For example,
.TP
.B
ssig 0,1 type 74F374 74F245
Clips on power and ground for all chips of type
.B 74F374
and
.BR 74F245 .
.TP
.B
pin 3-6,9 chip widget
Clips on pins 3,4,5,6,9 on chip
.BR widget .
.PP
.I Numbers
are specified as a
comma-separated list, possibly including
.BI \& lo - hi
ranges.
.PP
A missing
.I clipfile
argument is taken as
.ti 17n
.B
tt type ALL
.PP
.I Fizz cvt
converts \s-2CDL\s0 format input and outputs it in
.IR fizz (10.5)
format.
If no
.I files
are specified, standard input is read.
Typically,
.I fizz cvt
is used to process the output of
.IR cdmglob (10.1).
.PP
.I Fizz draw
generates a
.IR plot (10.5)
description of the board layout of
.IR files .
Standard input is used if there are no file arguments.
The options are
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B -p
Show pins (as circles).
.TP
.B -t
Show chip types rather than chip names.
.TP
.B -k
Show package names rather than chip names.
.TP
.B -v
Show special signal pins as \f2(n+3)\fP-gons
where \f2n\fP is the signal number.
.TP
.B -P
Draw package descriptions in
.IR pic (1)
format.
Each drawing shows the package name,
the bounding rectangle,
a cross at the origin, and numbered pin locations.
.PP
.I Fizz drills
takes a board description (in
.IR files )
and a set of drill diameters
.RI ( diams )
and produces a wraplist
(like that produced by
.I "fizz wrap" (10.1))
with an entry for every pin
whose diameter is in that set.
.PP
.I Fizz kollmorgen
generates the input files needed for Kollmorgen's router.  Output is to the standard
output.  The options are
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B -n
Produce nets
.TP
.B -b
Produce border (keepouts are also generated).  Wiring area shouldn't be too
unusual.
.TP
.B -h
Produce holes.  Holes may be wired ornot depending on the declaration.
.PP
.I Fizz mw
generates the input for the microwire router for the board described by the given
.I files
on standard output.
Standard input is used if no file arguments are given.
.PP
.I Fizz place
supports interactive chip placement on a board (described by
.IR files ).
It requires a Teletype 5620 terminal running
.IR mux (9).
The user interface is mouse-driven.
The main menu items are
.PD 0
.TP 15n
.B select
a submenu allowing selecting chips or signals by name.
Signals are displayed in the way they would be wired by
.I fizz wrap
(no
.B -3
support).
.TP
.B view
a submenu supporting zooming, panning, grid overlay and resolution.
.TP
.B insert
insert unplaced chips.
.TP
.B place
a submenu supporting manual placement, machine placement
and machine improvement of placement.
.TP
.B "read files"
reset the world and read the given (blank separated) filenames.
.TP
.B "write file"
write out the chip positions.
The filename conventionally should have a
.B .pos
suffix.
.TP
.B exit
finito.
.PP
Chips can be selected by button 1 or by the button 3 submenu.
Selected chips can be edited by the button 2 menu.
.PP
.I Fizz saf
outputs the packaging data suitable for giving to the automatic placement
machine at Lisle.
.PP
.I Fizz signal
gives information about signals in the board description in
.IR files .
Standard input is used if no file arguments are given.
By default,
all signals are shown as sequences of
.IR chip . pin ,
one signal per line.
Note that the lines for the ground and power signals are likely be very long.
The options are
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B -w
Wrap (route) signals before printing.
.TP
.BI -s name
Show the signal
.I name
as both
.IR chip . pin
and board coordinates (one point per line).
Unplaced chips have negative coordinates.
