.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR Quine , cover ,
and
.I hazard
are programs that read the standard input and write the standard
output, both in the format of
.IR minterm (10.5).
.PP
.I Quine
produces a Quine-McCluskey reduction of the input data.
.I Cover
does the covering problem, which is exponentially hard
and may not finish in reasonable time.
.B Cover -s
does not do the complete problem and goes faster.
.I Hazard
adds terms to eliminate internal hazards that can occur
in PAL's and PLA's. The hazard can occur when the form of the
equations is
.RI ( a & x )
|
.RI ( b &
.RI ! x ).
When
.I a
and
.I b
are both true
a glitch may appear on the output when
.I x
is changed.
.I Hazard
eliminates it by
adding another term
.RI ( a & b ).
If there are any
.BI - n
option flags for
.IR hazard ,
only those outputs whose symbols are in the set of
.IR n 's
will be modified by hazard, otherwise all outputs are
(possibly) modified.
