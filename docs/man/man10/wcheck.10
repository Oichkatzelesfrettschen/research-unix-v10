.TH WCHECK 10.1 UCDS
.SH NAME
wcheck \- static circuit checks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wcheck
.I files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wcheck
reads and checks a circuit description and reports simple errors found.
.PP
The circuit description language is 
.IR cdl (7).
The
.I files
are usually a board description file
.RB ( .wb )
made with
.BR "board -w",
a chips description file made with
.BR "mkchip -t" ,
and
(a) circuit description file(s) made with
.B "draw -w"
and/or
.BR cdm .
The chip descriptions must include lines beginning with
.BR \&.tt .
The rest of the line contains one character per pin on the chip according to
this table.
