.TH PAL 10.1 UCDS
.SH NAME
pal \- data preparation program for PAL's and PLA's
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pal
[
.BI - option
] [
.I type
[
.I filename
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pal
reads data from the standard input or
.I filename
in the form of
.IR minterm (10.5)
and writes on the standard output data suitable
for
.IR prom (10.1)
driving a PRO LOG programmer with a MMI PAL adapter.
.PP
The options are:
.TP
.B -x
Produce a table filled with '\-' (fuse blown) or 'X'
(fuse present) for checking by human being.
.TP
.B -d
Produce output suitable for use by
.IR drom (10.1)
driving a DATA I/O programmer with a LogicPak.
.PP
.I Pal
has internal tables that describe the fuse layout
and addressing inside the chips. The
.I type
flag on the command line is used to address the correct tables.
.I type
means the pal type, for example, "AM22V10".
.PP
The numeric symbol of a term that corresponds to the output
enable of a pin is 100 + pin_number by convention.  Just to be strange,
the convention for the 22V10 is: 200 + pin_number for polarity,
300 + pin_number for architecture fuses and pins 25 and 26 are
asynchronous reset and synchronous preset respectively.
.PP
The pals with X in their name use an additional convention.
Since
.IR quine (10.1)
can only handle and-or logic, and the X pals have two
different sets of and-or logic driving the two inputs of an xor gate,
those two terms are number 200 + output pin number and 300 + ditto.
