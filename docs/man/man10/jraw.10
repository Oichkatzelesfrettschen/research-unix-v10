.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Jraw
is an interactive schematics editor run under
.IR mux (9.1).
The schematic files have a conventional
.B \&.j
suffix.
The terminal program is controlled by menus;
via button 2
the user may define macro boundaries, create new boxes, put down existing
instances (from a library), define new instances as well as snarf, cut, paste
and scroll.  Button 3 edits a file (this erases the current drawing), writes
it, or reads another library file.  Note that read will destroy existing part
definitions.
.PP
Button 1 is used to draw lines as well as point to interesting points.  Typing
directly to
.I jraw
usually creates a string.  A string has two parts, separated by a carriage return.
Both of these parts are used by
.BR -w .
.PP
There are a few non-interactive uses of
.IR jraw .
.PD 0
.TP
.B -w

.I jraw
files to \s-2CDL\s0 format.

This is great for analog drawings.
