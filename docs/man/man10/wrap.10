.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fizz wrap
generates a wraplist for the given files.
Standard input is used if no file arguments are given.
To actually perform the wrap on the semi-automatic wiring machine, use
.BR "wrap -s" .
The analogy of
.IR diff (1)
for wraplists is
.IR rework (10).
The options are
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.B -3
3 wraps per pin may be used.
In this case, a minimal spanning tree of degree three is used for routing.
.TP
.B -n
pins not connected to any other
are wrapped in the net
.BR noconnect .
.TP
.B -o
option turns off complaints about signals with only one end.
.TP
.B -v
produce various statistics.
.TP
.B -c
produce output in units of 0.01in.
.TP
.B -x
produce XY mask output.
.TP
.B -b
tune XY mask output for buried micro-via technology rather than (the default)
four plane multiwire technology.
.TP
.BI -r root
put the artwork wiring in
.IB root .xym
and the hole and net descriptions in
.IB root .hn\fP\f1.
If
.B -r
is not used,
.I fizz wrap
sets
.I root
to the common prefix of
.IR files .
If there is no common prefix,
.I root
is set to
.BR a .
.sp
.PP
Ordinary
.I wrap
is a left over from the pre-fizz era.
If the input
.I file
name ends in
.B .wr
it is a wiring
.I object
file produced by an earlier use
.IR "fizz wrap" .
Otherwise the
.I files
describe the circuit in Circuit Description Language
.RI ( cdl (10.5)).
The form of output from
.I wrap
depends upon the type of wiring machine to be used
and is indicated by flag as follows.
.TP
.B -a
Automatic wire-wrap:
The output file is a series of 80 character lines, one per wire,
which are formatted as required by a commercial wiring service
that uses Gardner-Denver automatic wire-wrapping machines.
.PP
.TP
.B -d
Set preferred direction for wire routing.
A two-character string follows the
.BR -d .
The first character gives the first routing preference and the
second character the second routing preference.
The following code is used.
.TP
.B 0
route from left to right (increasing X).
.TP
.B 1
route from bottom to top (increasing Y).
.TP
.B 2
route from right to left (decreasing X).
.TP
.B 3
route from top to bottom (decreasing Y).
.TP
.B -h
Wire by hand.
A wire list is produced on the standard output.
The connections to be made for each signal are listed
in two columns: one for first-level wraps and
the other for second-level wraps.
The sequence of output is such that the board can be wired
in the sequence in which the connections are listed
without fear of placing a second-level wrap before a
first-level wrap on the same pin.
The wire length is given for each connection and it is
based upon a Manhattan route but excludes any allowance
for stripping.
Capital letters between the `from' and `to'
pins indicate the route to be followed.
.TP
.B -l
Listing.
The listing produced when no specific wiring machine is specified
contains for each signal a list of the pins in the sequence
in which the appear in the wired net.
The first two pins in the sequence will be connected by a level 1 wire
and wiring levels alternate thereafter.
If a machine is specified
the listing is intended as a reference for the
machine operator and describes the wires in the sequence
in which they are to be installed.
.TP
.B -q
Quick-connect wiring machine.
The output file is that required by the Quick-Connect wiring machine
designed by C. A. Von Roesgen.
It can be transmitted directly to the wiring machine.
.TP
.BI -r d
Set board rotation.
The digit
.I d
specifies how the board must be rotated from the
position implied by the Circuit Design Language definition of the board.
The rotation is the number of right-angles by which it is to be rotated
anti-clockwise, plus four if the board is first to be flipped over
(X and Y coordinates interchanged).
The initial rotation is given in the board definition.
.TP
.B -s
On-line semi-automatic wire-wrap machine.
The on-line Standard Logic wire-wrap machine must be in series with
the terminal from which
.B "wrap -s"
is used.
The operator will first be required to calibrate the machine
by moving the pointer to specified pin positions.
Then the machine will point at successive pins which must be wired.
The typed commands to which the program responds are as follows.
.RS
.TP
.B udlr
Move the pointer a small distance up, down, left or right.
If preceded by a number scale the distance moved accordingly.
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI s\| n
Skip to wire number
.I n.
.br
.ns
.TP
.B c
Check the calibration by moving the pointer to the reference pin.
.br
.ns
.TP
.SM
.B C
Check positions of all four corner pins of the board.
.br
.ns
.TP
.B v
Change to and from verbose mode.
.br
.ns
.TP
.B q
Quit after moving the pointer back to the reference pin.
.br
.ns
.TP
.B ?
Print details about the wire currently being installed.
.RE
.TP
.B -v
Set verbose mode.
The interpretation of this option depends upon the type of output
requested.
It is required to obtain details of all ground and voltage nets
when
.B -l
is used.
.TP
.B -y
Off-line semi-automatic wiring machine.
The output file
contains the control characters necessary
for driving a Gardner-Denver 14YN semi-automatic
wire-wrap machine equipped with automatic wire
stripper.
The data should be fed directly to a paper-tape punch.
