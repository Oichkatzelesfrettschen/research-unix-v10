.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smoke

.B wcheck

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Smoke
reads and checks a circuit and reports simple
errors like
.IR lint(1)
would find in C programs.
.PP
The circuit description language is 
.IR cdl (7).
The
.I files
are usually a circuit description file(s) made with
.IR jraw -w (10.1)
and/or
.IR cdmglob (10.1)
and the pins files with
.B \&.tt
lines like those given to
.IR cdmglob.
Files with net lists come first, pins files come second.
.PP
.I Wcheck
reads and checks a circuit description and reports simple errors found.
.PP
The circuit description language is 
.IR cdl (7).
The
.I files
are usually a board description file
.RB ( .wb )
made with
.BR "board -w",
a chips description file made with
.BR "mkchip -t" ,
and
(a) circuit description file(s) made with
.B "draw -w"
and/or
.BR cdm .
.PP
The .tt line contains one character per pin on the chip according to
the following table:
.sp

	\fB1\fP	open collector output
	\fB2\fP	totem pole ttl output
	\fB3\fP	3-state output
	\fBi\fP	input
	\fBp\fP	pull-up (for 1)
	\fBd\fP	pull-down
	\fB0\fP	1 and p

	\fB5\fP	1 and i
	\fB6\fP	1 and p and i

	\fBg\fP	ground

	\fB8\fP	analog output

The following are

	\fBA\fP	analog input/output pin
	\fBs\fP	switch contact
	\fBt\fP	terminator
	\fBb\fP	PAL undeclared pin
	\fBI\fP	current source (not supported)
	\fBJ\fP	current sink (not supported)
	\fBD\fP	+ driver
	\fBd\fP	- driver
	\fBR\fP	+ receiver

The various options for
.IR smoke
are
.TP 7
.B -a
Don't print out errors on analog nets.
.TP 7
.B -b
Don't print out errors on nets with bidirectional pins.
.TP 7
.B -c
Print out the entire circuit with type declarations by each pin (but
Does \fBnot\fP do any checking.
.TP 7
.B -l
Don't complain about loading errors.
.TP 7
.B -m
Don't complain about lone pins on macro signals.
.TP 7
.B -n
Turn on `complete' nets; when errors occur, nets will be completely printed
out (when used with
.BR -x ).
.TP 7
.B -p
Turn on paranoid mode;
.IR smoke
normally doesn't complain if 
there are any undeclared pins in a net.  Now it will.
.TP 7
.B -s
Ignore multiple source messages.  Not recommended for general use.
.TP 7
.B -x
Turn on extra (excessive) mode.  Offending nets will be printed out in
gory detail; \fIvery\fP useful for debugging the nets it complains about.
.TP 7
.B \-L
Ignore lonely pins with names beginning with
.B $
(local names).
.SH BUGS
In
.IR smoke,
the last definition of the chip is the one that counts.
Doesn't handle ECL.
