.TH EPROM 10.1 UCDS
.SH NAME
eprom \- read and write eproms through the Promac 2A promwriter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eprom
[
.I option
] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Eprom
serves as an interface to the RS-232 interface of the Promac 2A
promwriter.
Options are used to specify the eprom type, eprom manufacturer,
and whether the prom is to be read or written.
With no options eprom prints out a usage message.
.TP
.B -w
Specifies that the eprom is to be written; default is read.
.TP
.B -R
Specifies that the eprom is to be read.
.TP
.B -V
Specifies that the eprom is to be verified.
.TP
.B -P
Specifies that the eprom is to be programmed from data in Promac RAM
using block limits previously specified.
.TP
.B -L
Specifies that the eprom is to be copied to Promac RAM.
.TP
.B -D
Specifies that the Promac RAM is to be downloaded from the host
(no device is used).
.TP
.BI -s n
Specifies a starting address (default 0) in the eprom in decimal.
.TP
.BI -t string
.br
.ns
.TP
.I string
Specifies the device type of the eprom.
Note that if the eprom has a "silicon signature" neither the type
nor the manufacturer need be specified.
.TP
.BI -m string
.br
.ns
.TP
.I string
Specifies the manufacturer of the eprom.
Note that if the eprom has a "silicon signature" neither the type
nor the manufacturer need be specified.
.TP
.BI -d n
Specifies the (binary encoded) debug level.
.PP
To read an arbitrary 27256 eprom (which has silicon signature)
using the Promac one could say
.IP
.B
eprom -r > foo
.PP
or to write an Intel 2716 (which does not have a silicon signature)
one could say
.IP
.B
eprom -w -m int -t 2716 < filename
.PP
When an eprom is read, the addressed locations are copied
in binary onto the standard output.
When an eprom is written, the standard input is assumed to be
of the same form, and is copied onto the prom.
Most promwriter errors are reflected back to the user,
however a few appear only on the promwriter LCD.
Transmissions over the RS-232 line are checksummed,
and when writing the eprom is verified.
Transmissions between unix and the promwriter are in binary.
.PP
The speed of the prom writer should be set to 9600.
If the promwriter is not in remote mode, it must be initialized
by pushing the buttons, FUNC F 9 SET (however once in remote
mode it stays in remote mode until the RESET button is pushed,
even through power cycling).

.SH BUGS
If it goes off into a funny state the first time you use it, try again.
