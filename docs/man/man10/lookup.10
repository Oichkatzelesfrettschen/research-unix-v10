.TH LOOKUP 10.1 UCDS
.SH NAME
lookup \- lookup chips in the chip database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lookup
.I [type|chip|index]
chip
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Lookup
searches the chip database in one of three modes: 
.IR type
searches the database by type, e.g. driver or dsp.  However, certain
names are common (driver is one of them).
.IR index
should be used first to see all the fields for a given chip type.
After filtering the output, then use the "type" option to find
all chips of that type.
.IR chip
looks up all chips with that string, e.g. 2901 will find all 2901
chips.
.SH BUGS
The string matches are done exactly with grep; an inverted index 
would be better.
