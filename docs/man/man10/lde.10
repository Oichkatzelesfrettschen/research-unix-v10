lde \- logic design equation programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lde
[
.I option
] [
.I filename
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I lde
is the front end of a set of programs that prepare data
for fuse-programmable logic elements
such as roms or pla's.
It accepts an expression language,
.IR lde (10.5),
on its standard input or from filename and writes
an interpretation on its standard output.
The output format is selected
by options on the command line.
The options are:
.TP
.B -p
A single number is written
on each output line as required by
.IR prom (10.1)
or
.IR drom (10.1).
The pin numbers in the .i and .o areas of the input
are not used, instead, the order of appearance of
of variable names is used to assign their bit positions
in the address and data of the output.
This is the default action.
.TP
.B -x
Produce hex output instead of the default octal only
when used with the above.
.TP
.B -a
Produce 
.IR minterm (10.5)
output for the
.IR quine (10.1)
program.
Pin numbers in the .i and .o areas of the input are carried
through to the output.
.TP
.B -w
Produce a macro definition in
.IR cdl (10.5)
for use by
.IR cdm (10.1).
Pin numbers in the .i and .o areas are used
only if they are associated with the variable name with
a `:', other variable names do not appear in the output.
.TP
.B -W
Produce a chip descriptor file in the form of
.I /usr/ucds/lib/lib/pins
for use by
.IR cdm (10.1) or
.IR cdmglob (10.1).
.TP
.B -d -v -T -o
Produce other stuff to help debug the program.
.PP
Numeric parameters may be passed from the command line with
.TP
.BI - n
where
.I n
is decimal.
The (zero based)
.RI m th
occurence of
.BI \- n
substitutes the value
.I n
for the symbol
.B $m
in the input.

.SH BUGS
An output may appear or the left of the
assignment operator more than once
in which case
.I lde
produces unpredictable output without comment.
.br
An output may have been declared but not have been assigned to;
no diagnostic is given.
.br
Also,
.B \&.tt
lines must
.I not
have a space between pin declarations.
