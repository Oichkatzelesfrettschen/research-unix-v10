.SH DESCRIPTION
Package definitions in
.I fizz
format consist of a name, a bounding rectangle and pin placements.
These are transformed by
.B jpkg
into macros for
.IR jraw ,
which are produced on
.IR stdout .
The option
.L -b
gives a bottom view of the chips.
.PP
When collected in a file (preferably with suffix
.LR .j )
they can be read by
.I jraw
and placed by hand.
The shell-script
.B jpict
will process the resulting file, giving
.IR troff (5)
output that can be printed or previewd with
.IR proof (9).
.SH EXAMPLE
.EX
jpkg q.pkg > qpkg.j
jraw qpkg.j
jpict qpkg.j | proof

.SH SEE ALSO
.IR fizz (10),
.IR jraw (10)
.SH BUGS
One seems to have to take care in manipulating with
.IR jraw ,
as sometimes
.I pic
(called by
.BR jpict )
or the printer scheduler objects.
Best is to fit all objects onto one A4 page and keep all coordinates positive.
