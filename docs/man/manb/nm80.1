.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Nm80
prints the symbol table from the output file of an
assembler or loader run.
Each symbol name is preceded by its value (blanks if undefined)
and one of the letters:
.s1
\fBU\fR (undefined)
.br
\fBA\fR (absolute)
.br
\fBT\fR (text segment symbol)
.br
\fBD\fR (data segment symbol)
.br
\fBB\fR (bss segment symbol)
.br
\fBF\fR (file name)
.br
\fBC\fR (common symbol)
.s3
If the symbol is local (non-external)
the type letter is in lower case.
The output is sorted alphabetically.
.s3
If no file is given, the symbols in
.bd 80.out
are listed.
Absolute symbols have their values printed in octal.
Non-absolute symbols are assumed to be addresses
and are printed in a "low byte:high byte" format.
