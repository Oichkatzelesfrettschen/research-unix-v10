.sh NAME
"ld80"  \*-  link editor for the 8080/Z80 load moduals.
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd "ld80"
[
.bd \*-ultdb
] name ...
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it "ld80"
combines several
object programs into one; resolves external
references; and searches libraries.
In the simplest case the names of several object
programs are given, and
.it "ld80"
combines them, producing
an object module which can be either executed or
become the input for a further
.it "ld80"
run.
The output of
.it "ld80"
is left on
.bd "80.out".
This file is made executable
only if no errors occurred during the load.
.s3
The argument routines are concatenated in the order
specified.  The entry point of the output is the
beginning of the first routine.
.s3
If any argument is a library, it is searched exactly once
at the point it is encountered in the argument list.
Only those routines defining an unresolved external
reference are loaded.
If a routine from a library
references another routine in the library,
the referenced routine must appear after the
referencing routine in the library.
Thus the order of programs within libraries
is important.
.s3
.it "ld80"
understands several flag arguments which are written
preceded by a `\*-'.
Except for \fB\*-l\fR,
they should appear before the file names.
.s3
.lp +4 4
\fB\*-b\fR	This
option is used to provide an absolute origin for the bss segment
of the resultant "80.out".
The supplied origin must be the next argument on the command
line and must be a positive or negative octal (leading 0) or
decimal number.
The defualt is for the bss segment to immediately follow the data
segment.
Use of this option will cause the relocation information to
be suppressed from the output.
.s3
.lp +4 4
\fB\*-d\fR	This
option is used to provide an absolute origin for the data segment
of the resultant "80.out".
The supplied origin must be the next argument on the command
line and must be a positive or negative octal (leading 0) or
decimal number.
The default is to have the data placed directly
after the text.
Use of this option will cause the relocation information to
be suppressed from the output.
.s3
.lp +4 4
\fB\*-u\fR	take the following argument as a symbol and enter
it as undefined in the symbol table.  This is useful
for loading wholly from a library, since initially the symbol
table is empty and an unresolved reference is needed
to force the loading of the first routine.
.s3
.lp +4 4
\fB\*-t\fR	This
option is used to provide an absolute origin for the text segment
of the resultant "80.out".
The supplied origin must be the next argument on the command
line and must be a positive or negative octal (leading 0) or
decimal number.
The default origin is 0.
Use of this option will cause the relocation information to
be suppressed from the output.
.s3
.lp +4 4
\fB\*-l\fR	This
option is an abbreviation for a library name.
\fB\*-l\fR
alone stands for `/usr/z8080/lib/z80', which
is the standard library for assembly language
programs.
\fB\*-l\fIx\fR
stands for `/usr/z8080/lib/z80\fIx\fR.a' where \fIx\fR is any character.
A library is searched when its name is encountered,
so the placement of a \fB\*-l\fR
is significant.

.sh BUGS
Most diagnostics are self explanatory.
The strangest is 'origin - conflict' and
occurs whenever an origin supplied by the user via
the -t -d or -b options causes segments to overlap.
The numbers printed out correspond
origins and sizes(both in octal) of each resultant segment.
.bd "80.out"
is produced.
