During the decade since a volume of ``Documents for use with UNIX''
was first gathered for the sixth edition of the
.I "UNIX Programmer's Manual, 
the system has grown, and so has its literature.
In selecting the contents for this
new edition we have generally omitted
didactic topics, such as software design and the use of programming
languages, about which good books are available.
The following list suggests some important ones.
