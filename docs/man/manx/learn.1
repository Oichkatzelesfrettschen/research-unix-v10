.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Learn
gives CAI courses and practice in the use of UNIX.
To get started
simply type `learn'.
The program will ask questions to find out what
you want to do.
The questions may be bypassed by naming a
.I subject,
and the last
.I lesson
number that
.I learn
told you in the previous session.
You may also include a
.I speed
number that was given with the lesson number
(but without the parentheses that
.I learn
places around the speed number).
If
.I lesson
is 
.LR - ,
.I learn
prompts for each lesson;
this is useful for debugging.
.PP
The
.I subjects
presently handled are
.EX
      editor
      eqn
      files
      macros
      morefiles
      C
.EE
.PP
The special command
.L bye
terminates a
.I learn
session.
.PP
The
.BI - directory
option allows one to exercise a script in
a nonstandard place.
.SH FILES
.F /usr/learn/*
.SH BUGS
The main strength of
.I learn,
that it asks the student to use the real
UNIX, also makes possible baffling mistakes.
It is helpful, especially for nonprogrammers,
to have a UNIX initiate near at hand during the first
sessions.
.PP
Occasionally lessons are incorrect, sometimes because the local version
of a command operates in a non-standard way.
Such lessons may be skipped,
but it takes some sophistication to recognize
the situation.
