This is a set of routines that are not far from those necessary
to talk to the Radian controller "unixp" process.  This in turn is
supposed to be akin to some version of "standard" Datakit controllers.
Lee or Bill may be able to tell you what version.  The System V
analogue to mgrproc is somewhat of an expert system and adapts to
various versions; this one doesn't.

Not included in this stuff is the line discipline dev/unixpld.c,
which corresponds with cmcld.c.  It is part of the standard
v9 system and need only be mentioned in your conf file.
Similarly, required changes to the device drivers (kdi.c and dk.c)
have already been made.

These routines replace /etc/mgrproc, /etc/dkdialsub, and the tdkdial
and tdkmgr subroutines.  Thus they are set up for the old (not
connection-server) mechanisms.  It would be of benefit to adapt them
to the new regime; the most important advantage would be that
only the connection-server dkmgr program would have to be tailored.
Because this version has a new tdkdial, all programs that
make DK calls have to be relinked.

From memory, these are the differences between generic (PSDN, unixp)
and local (unx9p?) controller interfaces:
	generic probably uses a different control channel
	generic assigns incoming from high numbers, outgoing
	   from low numbers; local uses odd-even.
	the details of the messages are different


Here is a guide:

uxdialsub.c:  -> /etc/uxdialsub
	supersedes /etc/dkdialsub.
	This version passes the file descriptor for the callout
	channel back through the pipe created in _tdkdial (uxpdial.c).

Ouxpdial.c
	is an older version that uses much the same interface as the existing
	dkdialsub (not fd-passing).  It isn't supported by a calling
	routine; it might work if named /etc/dkdialsub.

uxpdial.c
	is a replacement for tdkdial.c, and I think the external
	interface is the same for the non-_ names (_tdkdial
	takes a string to select the intent instead of a code).

uxpctlchan.c:
	this implements assumptions about the name of the control
	channel; it seems to try /dev/dk/dk001 and /dev/dk/201
	depending on the traffic type, and if this fails,
	tries /dev/dk/dk01.  It also knows the number associated
	with uxp_ld (that's the 19).   This should be in the library.

uxmgrproc.c:
	This supplants /etc/mgrproc.

uxpmgr.c:
	supplants tdkmgr in the library.
	I don't know if it will work with servers other than
	uxmgrproc; if not, any changes should be trivial.
