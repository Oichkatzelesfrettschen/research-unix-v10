Posix P1003.2-compatible sort utility from Unix research v10 system.

To build it:
	make sort
To test it:
	make test

sort.1 is manual source; sort.man is the formatted version of it

Typical problems:
	On some systems the ANSI standard functions memmove.c
	and strtoul.c are slow or absent.  Code for these
	functions is included; use it if you have to
	(see Makefile).

	The sorttest suite uses awk as described in the
	Aho/Kernighan/Weinberger book.  Older versions of awk
	will fail, possibly even dumping core.  It tries awk
	and nawk and gawk before giving up.

	ANSI header files are assumed, but because headers
	vary among systems, you may have to do some clever
	rearrangement of #include directives.

Notes on "make fast":
	Standard IO is used for portability, despite the cost in
	speed.  The make file tries "make fast", and if that fails
	does "make slow".  Make fast uses a private addition
	to the classic System V stdio, not universally portable.
	In extreme cases (very long records in nearly sorted
	order) it can run 40% faster than the "make slow" version.
