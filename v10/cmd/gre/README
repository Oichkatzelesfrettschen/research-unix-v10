installation should be quite easy. set CFLAGS (in makefile)
to include a -DUSE_STDIO if you want to use stdio. otherwise
you will need fio. if you have a memmove in your C library,
use -DMEMMOVE; otherwise it will use memcpy (definition in hdr.h).

a simple regression test can be done by make regress.

the default C compiler is assumed to be ansi compliant (or c++).
if you don't have one, there is a deansify.awk to help.
look at the target oregress for how i use it.
