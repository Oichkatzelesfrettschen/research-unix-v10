To install and use the files in the CONFORM directory:

___ Copy and/or modify one of the comp*.h files into "compil.h"

___ Copy and/or modify one of the mach*.h files into "machin.h"

___ For "almost-ANSI" compilers, have "stubsh.h" and "stubs.c" configured by a local compiler expert

___ (If "makefile" is supported) Copy and/or modify one of the make* files into "makefile", with all local configurations

___ (If "makefile" is supported) Now execute   make all   which accomplishes the rest of the steps
    listed on this page.   If "makefile" is not supported, execute the rest of the steps listed on
    this page, using "scripts", "batch files", or interactive execution.

___ Compile "util.c" to produce "util.o"  (or "util.obj", or whatever)

___ Compile the following files, to produce "lang" (or "lang.exe", or whatever)

	lang.c c31.c c32.c c33a.c c33b.c c33c.c c34.c c35.c c35b.c c36.c c37.c c38.c util.o

___ At this stage (or any other), if you have compiler errors that prevented the production of the "lang"
	executable, you will need to find work-arounds, commenting-out, or "#if" exclusion to produce a "lang"
	executable.

___ Execute  "lang"  with output re-directed into "lang.out"

___ Compile the following files, to produce "prec1" (or "prec1.exe", or whatever)

	prec1.c  prec1a.c  prec1b.c  prec1c.c util.o

___ Execute  "prec1"  with output re-directed into "prec1.out"

___ Compile the following files, to produce "prec2" (or "prec2.exe", or whatever)

	prec2.c  prec2a.c  prec2b.c  prec2c.c util.o

___ Execute  "prec2"  with output re-directed into "prec2.out"

___ Compile the following files, to produce "lib" (or "lib.exe", or whatever)

	lib.c d41.c d42.c d42b.c d43.c d44.c d45.c d46.c d47.c d47b.c d48.c d49.c d49a.c d410.c d411.c d412.c util.o

___ Execute  "lib debug"  with output re-directed into "libdebug.out"
	(It is usually worth running "lib" once with the "debug" option, because
	most libraries have a tendency to give abends -- core dumps -- when probed harshly by "lib".)

___ Execute  "lib"  with output re-directed into "lib.out"

___ This concludes the installation of CONFORM.
