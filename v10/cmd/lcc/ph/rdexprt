___	In this directory, compilations need to be able to access "../compiler.h", "../machine.h", and "../defs.h".
	The "makefile" specifies inclusion search path of "../".  If "makefile" is not supported, or directory search
	is not supported, you may have to physically copy each of these three header files into this directory.

___	In this directory, compilations need to be able to access "../util.o".
	The "makefile" specifies the UTIL variable to be "../util.o".  If "makefile" is not supported, or directory search
	is not supported, you may have to physically copy the "util.o" file into this directory.

___ (If "makefile" is supported) Copy and/or modify one of the make* files into "makefile", with all local configurations

___ (If "makefile" is supported) Now execute   make all   which accomplishes the rest of the steps
    listed on this page.   If "makefile" is not supported, execute the rest of the steps listed on
    this page, using "scripts", "batch files", or interactive execution.

___	For each "filename.c" file in this directory, compile it and link it with "../util.o" (capturing any compile errors in
	a file "filename.z"), then execute it (directing its output onto the end of "filename.z").

___ At this stage (or any other), if you have compiler errors that prevented the production of the 
	executable, you will need to find work-arounds, commenting-out, or "#if" exclusion to produce an
	executable.

___	In this directory, however, the executables produced will not be needed for any further stages, so if
	any particular compilation is hopelessly riddled with compile errors, you may simply note this fact, and
	proceed further.

___	Catenate all of the "filename.z" files into one output file "all.out".  This file will document any compiler bugs
	which were revealed by the files in CONFORM/EXPRTEST.

___ This completes the installation of CONFORM/EXPRTEST.
