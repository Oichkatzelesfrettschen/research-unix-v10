This is a preliminary how to make 1" videos.

The action takes place on two machines. the 1" (hereafter referred
to as the 2500) is in pipe; the barco or source is on kwee.

before you start, set up the 2500 stuff on pipe by
going to the 5620 near the midi rack and download two layers.
the first layer is /usr/midi/bin/midiblt.
the second (after the first has completed) is /usr/midi/bin/xttyblt -o -38400.
This sets up a file called $HOME/.XTTY. If someone else
has already done this, set the variable XTTY to the appropriate value
(say /usr/gerard/.XTTY).

now you can run (on pipe) the 2500 command interpreter /usr/bin/2500.
the command help will list the grammar.
mostly you will want to run this from a script.
a script that works is

-------
still 5.0.0
wait
!rx kwee generate a frame somehow
snap [n]
# repeat the last two lines as necessary
still mode off
stop
-------

times (such as the 5.0.0) are [[hrs.]min.]sec.frame.
ask andrew to see where you should put your movie.
