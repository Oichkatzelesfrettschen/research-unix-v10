The pfort tape was read in using dd with a conversion from ebcdic
to ascii. The last eight characters on each line were removed.
Then all trailing blanks were removed. (These operations
were performed with the stream editor.)
Although it was not necessary to do so, pfort was then split
using fsplit into its subroutines and functions.
        The subroutines s5pack and s5unpk were then written
following A.D.Hall's specifications. Note that he expects
the array variables to be integers. We found it expedient,
however, to use character arrays internally to the subroutines.
This worked because fortran passes locations on a subroutine
call. These subroutines, located in files pack.f and unpack.f
were tested using tstpak.f.
        An f77 run command was placed in the file run. The command
run > out 2>tt2out
was then given. The file tt2 was constructed from tt2out by deleting all
lines containing the word warning. It was then seen that all files
were successfully compiled. However, the binary output file
PFORT was not executable. An examination of the file out
gave the message:
   L15 undefined
A grep of L15 on all .f files drew a blank. Is L15
some internal variable that would have been defined if I used
an appropriate library?

P.P.S. mktst is a makefile for tstpak packc and unpakc.
