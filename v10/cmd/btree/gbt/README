INSTALLING THE BTREE STUFF
Acceptance testing -
1.  Put the distributed software in a testing directory.
	Put the name of the directory in the LIB=  line in cbt.
	make all. (If you are not on a vax, remove the -g CFLAG in makefile.)
	(If your machine does not have ranlib, remove all references
	to it from the makefile.)
2.  Run the verify shell script with various arguments.  I use
	verify 10, verify 100, and verify 1000.  The last needs 3 minutes
	of cpu time.
3.  Copy everything to its final directory.  Fix the CFLAGS line in
	the makefile by removing -DTEST.  Change the LIB= line in cbt
	to point to this directory.  Change the NDSZ definition after
	#else in cbt.h to the size of a file system block on your system
	(512 or 1024 or whatever).
4.  make clean
	make all
	Run the verify shell script to check that everything is still ok.
5.  make install
