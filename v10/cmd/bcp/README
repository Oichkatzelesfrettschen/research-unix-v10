Copy bcp.cpio.z into an empty directory, cd there, and...
	unpack bcp.cpio.z
	cpio -ic <bcp.cpio
If your cpu is not a VAX or your OS is not research UNIX:
	edit CPU.h to specify SUN, CRAY, 3B, etc (and specify OS too)
	edit makefile to enable SUN, CRAY, 3B, etc compilation options
Next, defeat the UNIX file-tree code (later, you may decide you want this; but
it seldom ports easily), by taking these steps:
	1)  in CPU.h, change this line to:
		#define FILE_TREE 0
	2)  in makefile, remove all references to Path.c Path.o (this is
	    spelled out in the comments).
Then say:
	make
and hope for the best, which is a working `bcp'.
Bcp.1 and picfile.5 are man pages; print them using `troff -man'.
More detailed documentation can be found in source bcp.c.
