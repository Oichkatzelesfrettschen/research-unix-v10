The subdirectories contain files for our various flavors of machines.
Our two gateways are research (for traditional uucp connections) and arpa
(gateway to the Internet world.)  The rest of our machines are configured
to let arpa and research handle most of the mailing issues.

A machine configured for uucp transfers to the Outside World will probably
have a rewrite file like research's.  Similarly, arpa is a good prototype
for Internet stuff.  As Andrew would suggest, ``suck it and see!''
