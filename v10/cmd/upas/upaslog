added proper return values to smtp/header.c.  Also, this message should be logged
automatically in /n/bowell/usr/src/cmd/upas/upaslog, so it will be included in
future distributions.

 Fix a bug that left occassional error messages
without a return address, confusing smtpsched.

	Fix an error in smtpsched made it eat up all the memory
	in the machine from time to time.
	Bring inet's version up-to-date.
	Remove stale-lock messages to stderr in smtpsched:  they
	are just logged.
	In smtp, make unknown-user a fatal error.  Error processing
	codes in general weren't handled precisely right.
	Improved installation procedure for smtpqer and smtpsched
	to work better on a busy mail machine.

		/*fprintf(stderr, "breaking stale lock %s\n", s_to_c(ln));/**/

In qlib.c.  We are tired of seeing this mostly-pointless message.
