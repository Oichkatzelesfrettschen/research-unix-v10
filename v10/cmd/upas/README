There are 4 directories containing configuration info and
makefiles for making UPAS for different versions of UNIX:

v9:	for ninth edition
4bsd:	for Berkeley 4.[23] with MX entries
sun4bsd:for Sun 4.2 without MX entries
s5:	for system 5 (3B2)
s5.3k:	for system 5 on our Cray XMP

To make UPAS for your system:
1) cd to the directory for your flavor of UNIX.
2) type 'make' to compile UPAS.
3) become root.
4) type 'make install' to install UPAS.
5) examine config/*/rewrite and config/*/route.  Modify a copy of each
   to make sense for your system and copy it to /usr/lib/upas.

You now should have a working mail system.  If not 'run about, scream and shout'.

To change the directory where things are kept, modify the following makefile
variables and go back to step 1.
	LIB		- where the upas executables and data files reside
	MAIL		- where the mail files reside
	USERALIAS	- where user aliases reside
	SYSALIAS	- where system aliases reside
