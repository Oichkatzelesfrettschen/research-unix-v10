This directory contains a set of tests for Tcl commands.  Each of
the files *.test is intended to fully exercise one or a few Tcl
commands.  Eventually these files should cover all of the Tcl
commands, but currently there are only tests for a few of the Tcl
commands.  To run a particular test, "source" the file from tclTest.
If all goes well the file will produce no errors and no result.  If
the test detects problem, it will exit with a Tcl error message
that includes an error number;  this error number can be used along
with the text of the test file to pinpoint the problem.

To run the entire comprehensive test suite, type "source all" when
running tclTest in this directory.
