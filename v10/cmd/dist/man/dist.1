.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dist
distributes files to other systems, where they are installed
under the same names.
.I Dist
operates by packing the files with
.IR mkdist (1),
and queueing the resulting package in a spool directory to be
picked up by the remote systems.
.PP
.I Dist
has several forms of use.  In the first (default) form,
.I dist
packages the named files and queues them for remote systems.
By default, the list of remote systems is taken from
.BR /usr/lib/dist/destinations/default .
The
.B -d
option allows a list of destination systems to be specified as
a single argument (containing system names separated by spaces).
Similarly, the
.B -f
option allows a list of systems to be taken from a file.
The
.B -F
option is like
.BR -f ,
except it looks in a standard place for the file.
Multiple
.BR -d ,
.BR -f ,
and
.BR -F
options may be combined.  If any destinations are specified via
the command line, the default destinations file is not read.
The
.BR -D ,
.BR -X ,
and
.B -x
options are passed to
.IR mkdist .
By default, after packaging and queueing the files for distribution,
.I dist
notifies each remote system that the package is available, and the
remote system then dials back and immediately downloads the package.  The
.B -n
option suppresses this notification.
.PP
In the second form, when the
.B -q
option is given,
.I dist
displays the queue contents on each remote system named in the
command line.  If no remote systems are named,
.I dist
displays the local queue.
.PP
The third form, with the
.B -r
option, makes a network call to the named system
and attempts to download and install the named jobs.
If no jobs are named, it attempts to download all jobs
on the remote system.  The
.B -D
and
.B -R
options are passed to
.IR insdist (1).
The
.B -r
form is rarely used, since the default behavior is for
remote systems to automatically dial back when a package
is announced.
.PP
In all three forms of the command, the
.B -v
option enables verbose output.
