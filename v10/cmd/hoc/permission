Your question about the propriety and/or legality of
using and distributing the source for the hoc calculator
found its way to me by a rather roundabout route.

Rob and I have always felt that the code should be
easily available for people to experiment with.
As far as we are concerned,
the source code for hoc may be freely distributed
provided all copies of it and programs derived from
it indicate that they contain copyrighted material
from The Unix Programming Environment
by Kernighan & Pike, Prentice-Hall, 1984.

Good luck with your thesis.

Brian Kernighan
