lox deg
computes a loxodrome inclined at angle "deg" from
the equator; deg=45 for NE, deg=-45 for SE.
The loxodrome begins at lat,lon=0,0 and continues
through north latitudes.  The output fields are:
	phi	latitude
	x	coord of developed loxodrome
	y	ditto
	theta	(east!) longitude of point on loxodrome
	chi	angle of inclination (slope) of developed loxodrome
Both theta and chi increase continuously (beyond 360)

map loxodromic deg options
draws a map based on the developed loxodrome.  The globe is
cut along the antipodal loxodrome and points are displayed
at true distance from the developed central loxodrome.
The usual map options apply.
Latitudes beyond 85 are deemed unplottable; higher latitudes
could be squeezed out in some instances.

sh dolox deg options
makes the map with the boundary cut drawn.
If option -o is present, it must be first, and it should be
-o 90 ? ?  (For uninvestigated reasons, the scale of an
off-axis projection comes out a bit wrong, so you have to
hand-tune the drawing of the boundaries, as has been done
in "sh noedge"; see the differing -p options there.  One
contributor to the discrepancy: linear interpolation.)

This projection uses the heavy artillery of a general
integrator and a general equation solver from the port 3
library.  This triples the size of the object code of map;
moreover it requires a corrected version of subroutine ds7grd,
not in the publicly available Port 3.  Hence the loxodromic 
projection is not normally included in "map".
