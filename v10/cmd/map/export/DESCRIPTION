Changes 1-3 respond to your comments.  Nice to see
a quiescent program come to life again.

1. Fixes the small-area bug.

2. Plots unknown symbols as if they were labels.

3. Manual gives an example for tracks, labels, and -y.

4. Fixes an error in plotting boundaries of maps
in nostandard position.  (It could plot the date line
when that is internal to the map.)

5. Deletes some fossil code.
