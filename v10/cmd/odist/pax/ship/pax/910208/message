pax (portable archive interchange) is in POSIX P1003.2 as a replacement
for both tar and cpio.  It supports both tar and cpio archive formats
and is used to implement tar and cpio via shell script wrappers.  This
version has extensions that support ANSI and IBM labelled tapes, VMS
backup tapes (read only), and file delta archives.
