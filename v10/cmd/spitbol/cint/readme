Hi Andy,

Here's what we have:

	(1) osint.c - main module for compiler

	(2) osint.h - header file for ALL osint C language functions

	(3) vaxinter.s - all assembly language routines and global data
		for new interface scheme

	(4) various additional sysxx.c functions

	(5) spitblks.h & spitio.h got some new comments

	(6) streamlined osint.s reflecting additional C functions and
		vaxinter.s

I suggest that you take a close look at osint.c, osint.h, and vaxinter.s.

Forget about my comments the other day about field names.  The Computer
Innovations C compiler (C86) ONLY objects to the the two definitions of 
field BUF in bfblk and ioblk, header file spitio.h.  Other duplicate field
definitions, such as typ and len, are accepted since they are in the
same position.  (It would be nice to remove the problem with buf as it is
the only error preventing me from doing compiles on my PC.)

Give this stuff a try.  I'm sure there will be something wrong, but
hopefully you can find it or me quickly.

Also, I have included rbsb.sh from the YAM distribution kit.  This would
allow me to directly transfer files between my PC and a Unix system of
your choice by dial-up phone connection.

	Bob
