^Energy Needs Clash With Religion Over Daylight-Saving<
^By JOEL EPSTEIN=
^Associated Press Writer=
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli clocks moved back one hour
Sunday, and a conflict between the religious and economic
imperatives of this nation died down _ at least until next summer.
	   Religious Jews say that during the six weeks it was in force
this summer, daylight-saving time caused widespread violations of
the holy Sabbath because it threw out of balance the ecclesiastical
timetables, which are based on the rising and setting of the sun.
	   In some towns, seminary students took to the streets, threw
stones and clashed with police in their attempts to enforce the
Sabbath by stopping buses and the movies. Public transport and
entertainment are regarded as violations of the holy day and do not
function from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday.
	   The rabbis complained that when clocks moved forward by one
hour, buses and movie theaters started to operate before the
Sabbath ended.
	   ``There was severe desecration of the Sabbath,'' said Rabbi
Yehiel Halevy, secretary of the official Chief Rabbinate Council.
``We don't support the violence, but we still demand the law be
changed to do away with daylight-saving time next year.''
	   Energy conservationists insist the electricity saved by turning
on lights an hour later easily justified daylight-saving. They also
say daylight-saving time has been adopted by the United States,
Europe and much of the rest of the world and is essential for
energy-starved Israel.
	   ``Estimates of the energy savings run from $1 million to $10
million,'' said an Energy Ministry official. ``But even if the
saving is minimal, we should still do it next year.''
	   Israeli law requires daylight-saving, but it took a bitter court
fight before the system finally was adopted for the first time this
summer.
	   The Interior Ministry, which is the country's timekeeper, is
headed by Yosef Burg, a leader of the National Religious Party, on
which Prime Minister Menachem Begin's coalition depends for a
majority in Parliament.
	   For years Burg ignored the law and refused to authorize
daylight-saving time. But last July the Supreme Court upheld an
appeal by a secular citizen and ordered the government to set
clocks forward in summer.
	   The Interior Ministry fought bitterly in court, going so far as
to produce doctors to testify that daylight-saving upsets people's
``biorythms.''
	   The religious lobby wants the law requiring daylight-saving
repealed. If it is not, observers see a strong likelihood of
renewed religious unrest in defense of the Sabbath next summer.

^House Begins Debate On Chemical Dumps Issue<
^By WILLIAM KRONHOLM=
^Associated Press Writer=
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House begins debate this week on
legislation establishing a $1.2 billion ``superfund'' to clean up
abandoned hazardous chemical dumps such as that at Love Canal in
New York.
	   The superfund proposal follows a surgeon general's report
released late last week describing the problem of toxic chemicals
as ``a major public health concern'' that will plague the nation
for years.
	   And it comes after two days of hearings last week on the Senate
version of the bill, during which federal, state and local
officials called for urgent congressional action on the problem.
	   But the legislation faces obstacles in the form of the Chemical
Manufacturers Association and other industry groups.
	   Although the industry prefers the House version of a superfund
to a much more ambitious Senate version, the association still
feels the fund is too big and puts too much of a burden on the
industry.
	   Also before the House this week is an expected vote Tuesday on a
$156 billion defense appropriation bill that includes funds for new
``Stealth'' measures to hide bombers from enemy radar.
	   In the Senate, national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and
other White House aides are scheduled to testify at hearings on the
Billy Carter affair.
	   Senate investigators want to ask Brzezinski about his disclosure
to Billy Carter that U.S. intelligence had intercepted one of his
cables to Libya.
	   ``Superfund'' is Congress' response to such environmental
disasters as Love Canal, where a neighborhood was built on top of
an abandoned chemical dump that eventually began to poison its
residents.
	   More ``Love Canals'' have been found since then, and the threat
of chemicals invading the environment has grown ever more alarming.
	   The surgeon general, in his report last week, said more and more
``environmental emergencies'' like Love Canal will occur over the
coming years.
	   And Douglas Costle, administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency, testified last week that ``this legacy of many
years of uncontrolled hazardous waste disposal may well be the most
serious environmental problem facing the nation today.''
	   The major superfund bill to come before the House this week
would set up a $1.2 billion, four-year program to clean up
abandoned chemical waste dumps. Of the total, $900 million would
come from taxes on the chemical industry and $300 million from the
federal treasury.
	   The scope of the project is limited compared with the Senate's
proposed $4 billion, six-year program, which is pending in the
Senate Finance Committee.
	   The House bill covers only the actual costs of cleaning up a
dump. The Senate version, by contrast, sets aside one-third of its
fund for compensating chemical waste victims for everything from
medical expenses to property damage.
	   Two smaller ``superfunds'' would be created by a second bill
before the House. It would set up one fund for oil spills and one
for hazardous substance spills, putting them in a separate category
than waste dumps.
	   Those funds would get their money from new excise taxes on oil,
petrochemical feedstocks and certain inorganic chemicals. The taxes
would funnel $75 million a year into each of the two funds.

^Rhodes Says Anderson May Hurt Election OF GOP Congressmen<
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ House minority leader John Rhodes said Sunday he
doesn't think President Carter should engage in campaign debates,
but independent candidate John Anderson is not the reason.
	   ``I just don't believe that the debates prove anything, and they
can be dangerous to the policy,'' Rhodes said. ``Under the stress
of the moment, a sitting president is liable to say some things
that might harm our foreign policy or our domestic policy.''
	   But he said avoiding the debates because of Anderson was
``specious.''
	   The GOP leader, who was interviewed on the CBS-TV program ``Face
the Nation,'' also said he was afraid that Anderson's candidacy
might draw liberal voters to the polls, hurting efforts to elect a
Republican Congress.
	   ``The existence of John Anderson as a presidential candidate
might well help Ronald Reagan, but might well hurt the Republican
candidates for the House and the Senate,'' Rhodes said.
	   The minority leader said he did not believe Anderson would draw
enough votes to throw the election into the House of
Representatives. In fact, he said, ``I don't think John Anderson
will take any states.''

^Veteran Texas Politicans To Trial In Briland Case<
^By SHARON HERBAUGH=
^Associated Press Writer=
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ In the first trial stemming from the FBI's
undercover Brilab investigation of governmental corruption, Texas
House Speaker Billy Clayton goes to court Monday on charges he
accepted a $5,000 bribe.
	   Clayton and Austin attorneys Randall B. Wood and Donald W. Ray
are accused of racketeering, extortion, fraud and conspiracy in an
alleged insurance kickback scheme.
	   The government charged Clayton, a 20-year veteran of the Texas
legislature, accepted a $5,000 payment from L.G. Moore, regional
director of the Operating Engineers Union, with promises of an
additional $600,000 if he reopened a $76 million state employee
insurance contract.
	   Brilab, which takes its name from the words bribery and labor,
stems from the FBI's undercover investigation into alleged
insurance kickbacks involving politicians and public employee labor
unions.
	   More than 100 people have been summoned to appear before U.S.
District Judge Robert O'Conor when jury selection begins Monday
morning.
	   Clayton may be denied the testimony of one key witness defense
attorneys claim could defuse many statements made in conversations
secretly taped by the FBI during the investigation.
	   Defense attorneys, who have accused the government of
``entrapment,'' suffered a major setback Friday when Supreme Court
Justice Lewis Powell Jr. refused to reinstate a ``protective
order'' giving Moore limited immunity if he testified on behalf of
Clayton.
	   Without immunity, Moore's attorney says his client will not take
the stand.
	   ``The waters are filled with too many sharks,'' said attorney
Mike Ramsey, noting the government has threated to file other
charges against Moore.
	   A federal grand jury also indicted Moore on similar charges.
Last month, O'Conor granted the union leader immunity and promised
testimoney would be sealed and unavailable to prosecutors in other
trials.
	   But the government appealed, and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled O'Conor acted without the consent of prosecutors and
revoked the order.
	   Defense attorneys asked Powell to reinstate O'Conor's action,
but the high court justice refused.
	   The government's case rests on a secretly taped conversation in
a Nov. 8, 1970, meeting between Clayton, Moore and FBI informant
Joseph Hauser, who posed through the 10-month investigation as an
agent for Prudential Insurance Co.
	   Clayton acknowledged receiving the money, but has said he
thought it was a campaign contribution and intended to return the
stack of $100 bills.
	   The speaker, who has hinted of running for governor in 1982,
never reported the contribution.

^Baker Sees Little Gain for Carter in Hostage Release<
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Senate Republican Leader Howard H. Baker Jr.
said Sunday that release of the American hostages in Iran might
help President Carter politically, but would not ``significantly
affect the outcome of the election.''
	   Baker said in a broadcast interview he believes ``there is
genuine movement'' in the hostage situation.
	   The Tennessee senator said he knows little more than what has
been published.
	   Baker credited the apparent change in the situation to the
letter Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie wrote to the Iranian
parliament suggesting there be a revival of negotiations for
release of the 52 hostages who have been held in Iran since last
Nov. 4.
	   ``There is no denying,'' said Baker, ``that the release of the
hostages together with the celebration of that event, and their
triumphal homecoming, may have positive effects for President
Carter politically.''
	   Baker added, however, that ``I rather suspect that it will be a
minor plus. I do not think it is likely to significantly affect the
outcome of the election.''
	   Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan urged Saturday
night that the United States agree to three of the four conditions
laid down Friday by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in return for
the immediate release of the hostages. The fourth demand, involving
return of the late Shah of Iran's wealth, cannot be met ``without
due process of law,'' Reagan said.
	   Carter has not responded to Reagan's proposal. White House
officials earlier had said only that the president was studying
Khomeini's latest conditions, which omitted mention of the previous
demand for a U.S. apology.
	   The three Khomeini demands which Reagan said the United States
should meet were to cancel all claims against Iran, release frozen
Iranian assets and promise not to interfere in Iran's internal
affairs.
	   On another issue, Baker disclosed he had met with Carter on
Sunday to complain about what the senator called ``an emerging
pattern of national security leaks that appear to have a
self-serving political end.''
	   Baker said he urged the president to order an internal
government investigation and to name a prominent Republican to
oversee it. He said Carter was agreeable to conducting an inquiry,
but balked at the having it monitored by a Republican.
	   Baker said he wanted to ``find out whether or not administration
officials are selectively leaking national security information to
try and further the political career of President Carter and to
damage the political prospects of Governor Reagan.''
	   Baker cited the recent disclosure that the United States is
developing a ``Stealth'' warplane that would be invisible to enemy
radar.
	   He said Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss., chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, has refused to agree to a congressional
investigation of how the Stealth disclosure was handled by the
administration.
	   Reagan and other Republicans have complained that the disclosure
was politically motivated and intended to counter charges that the
Carter administration is neglecting U.S. defenses.

^Eds: CORRECTS spelling of women's in lead.<
^Adv for 6 p.m. EDT<
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In God the American woman has trust; but
Congress, auto manufacturers, newspapers, the president and nuclear
plant operators all have slipped in women's estimation over the
past decade, according to a survey.
	   The poll of 1,000 women by Ladies Home Journal also indicates
that women said their ``most trusted'' individual in each of four
categories _ film or television stars, writers or columnists,
religious leaders and political leaders _ was ``none.''
	   Only among newscasters was an individual singled out as most
trusted _ Walter Cronkite, who was named by 40 percent. ``None''
followed with 31 percent, NBC anchorman John Chancellor was named
by 5 percent and Dan Rather _ Cronkite's successor as CBS anchorman
_ received 4 percent.
	   ``World pressures are enormous ...,'' Cronkite told the
magazine. ``When things don't seem to be working, we blame the
managers. We clutch our own, and reach out to make sure we're
getting our piece of the diminishing pie. We're inclined, perhaps,
to cheat a little. And we lose trust in each other.''
	   Despite these problems, Cronkite said he had ``trust in
America.''
	   Among political leaders, ``none'' received a 43 percent trust
rating. Former President Gerald Ford got 11 percent. President
Carter got 10 percent, beating his opponent in the November
election, Ronald Reagan, who was named as ``most trusted'' by 4
percent of those surveyed.
	   ``None'' also was most trusted among religious leaders, with 36
percent. Pope John Paul II was named most trusted by 26 percent, 6
percent named Billy Graham and 3 percent named God.
	   Nonetheless, God received a plus-60 rating for trust over the
past decade, obtained by subtracting the percentage who said their
trust in God had decreased over the past 10 years from the
percentage who said it had increased.
	   Computers got a plus-2 rating, but all others got negative
ratings. The worst were Congress, minus 81; auto manufacturers,
minus 71; state government, minus 64; nuclear power plant
operators, minus 60; the president, minus 55, and the courts, minus
54.
	   The magazine also gave the women a list of 17 occupations, and
asked what sex they trusted most in those jobs. Most said they
trusted professionals of both sexes equally, except for
electricians, airline pilots and police officers, where the
preference is for males.
	   However, the remaining respondents had more faith in men than
women, except when it comes to nurses, first-grade teachers and
secretaries.
	   The magazine said the women it polled were randomly selected
from among its subscribers nationally.
