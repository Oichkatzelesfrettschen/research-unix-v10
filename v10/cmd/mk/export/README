mk runs on Unix V9. To run on other systems requires some help.
the help takes the form of the fast i/o library (fio) and some
libc routines. dir.o provides support for the directory routines
on V7-style filesystems; on most modern systems you should probably
not use dir.o.

	- edit Makefile by setting the initial variables as
per the instructions.

	- type make (unless on the cray, in which case, type make cray).

	- everything should now be compiled and you should have a mk.

	- edit mkfile to set the system type as in the Makefile

as a first order test that all is well, try
	mk
which generates a `correctly compiled' mk in the file nmk.

If things go badly, (core dump hell), try not using alloc.c. it may be
that your hardware needs special alloc treatment. otherwise, mail
research!andrew (or andrew@research.att.com).

the manual page and a tutorial style document are included.
