- added a new command: reference_include let's you include
	a database file of references in a list of references without
	having to cite each reference in the text.

- integrated some more exptool changes



Sat Feb 27 15:44:52 EST 1988

- prefer's -s option and the |reference_style command let you supply your
	own style awk script.

- pinvert now stores the name of the common word file (-c option)
	and the max keyword length (-l option) in the *.h file.
	Likewise, plook and prefer expect to read these values
	from the *.h file so you will need to rerun pinvert on all
	your old bibliography databases.

- prefer no longer aborts when it cannot find a bibliography database;
	instead it scans thru its entire input, processing as many prefer
	commands as it can.

- plook does an exit(1) when it can't find anything

- miscellaneous bug fixes: %verbatim() command, sorting authors names and dates




Sat Sep 12 23:15:22 EDT 1987

- added %verbatim() command
	to keep author's names from being permuted; this can be
	used for corporate authors: %verbatim(AT&T Bell Laboratories).

- ported to 4.3BSD on a Sun

- picked up changes for EXPTOOLS

- miscellaneous bug fixes

		where searchkeys are just like keywords in |reference()
		and are used to search the database for a matching reference.

		allowing "Also..." stuff in a reference to be
		formatted correctly.
		An alterntive format is
			%also_begin text
