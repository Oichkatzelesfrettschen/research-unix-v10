: REFER TEMPLATE FILE
:
: Format:  Each entry or field name appears on a separate line.
: An entry name appears at the left margin; it is followed by all
: of its component field names.  Each field name appears after
: a single <TAB> character, and a possible modifier.
: each field name is followed by a single <TAB> character and the
: appropriate string to output for the first occurence of the field.
: This field is followed by an optional <TAB> and the continue field to output
: for the middle occurences of the field or the word "NULL".
: This field is followed by an optional <TAB> and the continue field to output
: for the last occurence of the field or the word "NULL".
: Except as noted below, all fields are prompted for during
: insert mode.
:
: Fields may be preceded by a single modifier character.  If no
: modifier is present, the field is REQUIRED.  The modifiers are:
: ?	Field is OPTIONAL.  It will be prompted for.
: -	Field is EXTRA -- ignored by refer.  It will, however, be
:	prompted for.  This is used, for example, for "Keywords".
: !	Field is OCCASIONAL -- maybe used by refer, maybe not.  It
:	will NOT be prompted for.  This is used for note, annote,
:	editors, etc.; these are understood by refer, but are
:	rather nonstandard, and probably should not be prompted for.
: Fields may be followed by [default value], where the default value will be
: used if a carriage return is given.  If no default value field is given
: a carriage return will mean do not output this field.
:
: Comment lines are preceded by a colon.
