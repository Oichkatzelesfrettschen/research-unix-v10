The docgen program with the -mcs option is designed to help you generate
a document cover sheet without understanding or remembering the special
cover sheet formatting command names. Simply answer the questions with the
correct information (or type a carriage return to indicate that there is
no information).

In several instances you will be given the choice of reading the text from
a file (by typing ':r' followed by the filename) or typing the information in
directly. If any of the following items are lengthy, it probably will be most
convenient to read the data from a file prepared earlier: abstract, complete
copy distribution list, cover sheet only distribution list. If you have no data
to input for any one of these items, simply type a colon(:) followed by a
carriage return.

After you have answered all the questions, you will find that docgen has
written (or appended) the information to the output file (default temp.cover)
in your directory. This file is ready to troff. The ms macros will be loaded
for you.
