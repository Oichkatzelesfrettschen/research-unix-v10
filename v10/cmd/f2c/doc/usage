Subject: new version


	Hi,

	I've put out a new version of f2c.  This one has the command line
option "-p", for Pretty Common references.  If you use -p, all common
fields will have only underscores prepended, rather than the complete 
reference to the common block.  There will also be a bunch of #defines
and #undefs printed, some of which are unneeded.  Try it out, and if you
like I can put in a bug report to eliminate those defines which aren't
used.
