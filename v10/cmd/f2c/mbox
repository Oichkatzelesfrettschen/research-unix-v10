harvy brendzel, a "liason lawyer" in our relations with Bellcore,
has suggested that we grease the rails for the f77->C converter release.
specifically, he says that we can bag the system by submitting for "release"
a one-page description of the project we intend, and lalebling it as
a "notice" to the rest of at&t of our intent. failure of other parts
of at&t or bellcore to object or comment now will doom them to silence
when the real thing hits the fan later.

could you please look at /n/coma/usr/nls/doc/triage/now/f77.c/pre.release
and see if it looks ok to you?

changes to f77: driver.c added ">> 8" to "return(system(str) >> 8);"

f1 (pcc1/pcc): changed BITOOR from macro to
 long
BITOOR(x)
 register long x;
{ return x >= 0 ? (x>>3) : -((-x)>>3); }
