re- recent f2c fixes

Mon Jun 18 16:58:31 EDT 1990:
  Trivial updates to f2c.ps .  ("Fortran 8x" --> "Fortran 90"; omit
"(draft)" from "(draft) ANSI C".)

Tue Jun 19 07:36:32 EDT 1990:
  Fix incorrect code generated for ELSE IF(expression involving
function call passing non-constant substring).
  Under -h, preserve the property that strings are null-terminated
where possible.
  Remove spaces between # and define in lex.c output.c parse.h .

Mon Jun 25 07:22:59 EDT 1990:
  Minor tweak to makefile to reduce unnecessary recompilations.

Tue Jun 26 11:49:53 EDT 1990:
  Fix unintended truncation of some integer constants on machines
where casting a long to (int) may change the value.  E.g., when f2c
ran on machines with 16-bit ints, "i = 99999" was being translated
to "i = -31073;".
  net f2c/src files changed:
	expr.c f2c.ps format.c formatdata.c lex.c makefile names.c
	output.c p1output.c parse.h putpcc.c version.c xsum0.out
