Now available for "friendly use", f2c converts Fortran 77
source code to C.  By default, it tries for bit-level
compatibility with f77.  Usage:
	f2c [flags] file ...
File names must end in .f or .F; corresponding .c files are
produced in the current directory (unless no file arguments
are given, in which case f2c acts as a filter).  `man f2c`
describes flags and other details.  Bug reports to dmg.
