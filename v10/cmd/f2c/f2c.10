.SH NAME
f\^2c \(mi Convert Fortran 77 to C
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B f\^2c
[
.I option ...
]
.I file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I F2c
converts Fortran 77 source code to C.
Arguments that end with
.L .f
or
.L .F
are taken to be
Fortran 77 source programs;
each is converted to a C source file in the
current directory
whose name is that of the source with 
.L .c
substituted
for the final
.L .f
or
.LR .F .
If no
.I file
arguments are given, then
.I f\^2c
reads Fortran 77 on its standard input and
writes the resulting C on its standard output.
.PP
The following options have the same meaning as in
.IR f\^77 (1).
.TP
.B -w
Suppress all warning messages.
.TP
.B -w66
Suppress Fortran 66 compatibility warnings.
.TP
.B -onetrip
Compile DO loops that are performed at least once if reached.
(Fortran 77 DO loops are not performed at all if the upper limit is smaller than the lower limit.)
.TP
.B -u
Make the default type of a variable `undefined' rather than using the default Fortran rules.
.TP
.B -C
Compile code to check that subscripts are within declared array bounds.
.TP
.B -I2
Render INTEGER and LOGICAL as short,
INTEGER\(**4 as long int.  Assume the default \fIlibF77\fR
and \fIlibI77\fR:  allow only INTEGER\(**4 (and no LOGICAL)
variables in INQUIREs.
.TP
.B -U
Honor the case of variable and external names.  Fortran keywords must be in
.I
lower
case.
.PP
The following options are peculiar to
.IR f\^2c .
.TP
.B -A
Use ANSI C constructs.  The default is old-style (pre-ANSI) C.
.TP
.B -R
Do not promote REAL functions and operations to DOUBLE PRECISION (as
.I f\^77
does).
. \".TP
. \".B -ext
. \"Complain about f77 extensions.
.TP
.B -i2
Similar to \f(CW-I2\fR, but assume a modified \fIlibF77\fR and \fIlibI77\fR
(compiled with \f(CW-Df2c_i2\fR),
so INTEGER and LOGICAL variables may be assigned in INQUIREs.
.TP
.B -a
Give local variables automatic (rather than static) storage
unless they appear in a DATA, EQUIVALENCE, or SAVE statement.
.TP
.B -r8
Promote REAL to DOUBLE PRECISION, COMPLEX to DOUBLE COMPLEX.
.TP
.B -z
Do not implicitly recognize DOUBLE COMPLEX.
.PP
The resulting C invokes routines from
.IR f\^77 's
support libraries,
.I libI77
and
.IR libF77 ;
programs should be loaded by  \f(CWf77 \fR...  or
by  \f(CWcc \fR...\f(CW -lI77 -lF77 -lm\fR .  Calling conventions
are those of
.IR f\&77 :
see the reference below.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics produced by
.I f\^2c
are intended to be
self-explanatory.
.SH BUGS
Floating-point constants of over 17 significant digits are rounded to 17
significant digits.
