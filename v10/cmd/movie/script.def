OBJECTS
Text
%   text <options> <x> <y> <string>
	Quote rules for string:
	    If no leading quote, string starts at first character not
		space or tab and goes for rest of line
	    If leading quote, later leading white space is kept and
		trailing quote at end of line is stripped (if present);
		intermediate quotes are kept
	Some strings may be recognized by some processors:
	    bullet, dot, circle, times
	Options -- [default] in brackets
	    [center]  ljust  rjust  above  below
	    small  [medium]  big  bigbig
	Option format (for text and geometry):
	    list of option names (possibly null) terminated by first number
Geometry
%   line <options> <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>
	Options
	    [solid]  fat  fatfat  dotted  dashed
	    [-]  ->  <-  <->
%   box <options> <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>
	Options
	    [nofill]  fill
%   circle <options> <x1> <y1> <radius>
	Radius measured in x dimension
	Options
	    [nofill]  fill

HOUSEKEEPING
Erasing
%   (label:) <text or geometric command>
	At most one label per line
%   erase <label>
	Distinct name space for each view
	``foo: command'' implicitly deletes previous foo
	Error if object never defined or already deleted
%   clear
	Erase all objects currently in current view
Time
%   click <optional name>
Independent views
%   view <name>
	If no view statements appear, there is a single implicit view def.view
	If geometry appears before any view statement, it goes in the
	    first view mentioned, and a warning is generated
