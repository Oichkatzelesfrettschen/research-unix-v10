    .begin stills and .end) into pic, and passes all else through

STATEMENTS (A file and print are mandatory; all else optional.)

#   comment -- must be first nonblank character on line

view <name> <optional title, with blanks>
    named views appear in order
    if no view statements, all views are displayed
    if title is enclosed in quotes, leading space is kept
    if no title is given on a line, view name is used as a title

print statements (any number of the following forms)
    print all			Every click
    print final			End of file
    print <clickname> all	All clicks of clickname
    print <clickname> <int>+	Designated click numbers of clickname
