Dear Mr. Bentley,

In a recent edition of the AT&T Technical Report, I read
about a collection of tools for algorithm animation developed
by Brian Kernighan and yourself.  While I was a student at
Moravian College, I attended several of your ACM sponsored
lectures and recall your discussion of this work.

I recently acquired a DMD 5620 and am beginning to explore it's
capabilities.  I am interested in adding some of these tools to my
software toolchest.  I do not have an immediate need for such
tools, but I can see situations where knowing how to use them
would be helpful. 

The article mentions that source code is available.  Can you
give me an idea of how much space is needed, procedures for
obtaining, available documentation, etc?

Due to recent security enhancements, you may not be able to
communicate with me via electronic mail.  If UNIX mail proves
unsuccessful, I can be reached by the following other ways:

I am interested in obtaining a copy of "anim" for the SUNs. If you could put it
on forte, I could ftp it to our SUNs at ALC. Thanks.

I'd like to get a copy of anim.  I'm on an Amdahl if that makes
a difference.  If you've already sent it to someone in Summit,
I can get it from that person.

I just read in the AT&T Tech Report that you're distributing anim.
I heard your usenix talk in Atlanta - the technique sounds appealing.
I'd like to use it to simulate various algorithms for a new object-oriented
file system.
We use both DMDs and Sun 3's here - could you send us both versions?

Thanks kindly,

	Could you send me the source code for anim? I am going to be
a Visiting Professor and anim could be an invaluable teaching tool.
I am planning to use it to write programs to complement a Data Struc-

Do you know of any 5620 emulators that will

Could you provide me with the code and documentation of anim?
We are doing a project with AT&T audit and it may come in handy.

I will look it over and see if we can use it.

Jon,

	I recently read an article in the AT&T Technical Report on a set of UNIX
programs developed by you and Brian Kernighan that provide a basic system for
algorithm animation.  It sounds fascinating and I would like to investigate
this further. Could you please provide me with the necessary info (i.e. code and
documentation so that I may try these programs out myself?  Any help in this 
matter will be greatly appreciated.

Dear Jon,

I have been working on a message passing animator called GADD (Graphical
Animated Design and Debugger), and read with interest about your
algorithm animation system.  Could you send me a copy of the DMD 
version of it?  It sounds quite interesting.  

Thanks,

use it on a 3B2.

I was intrigued by the article in the A T & T Technical
Report on your tool, anim.  You don't explicitly mention
using the tool for performance studies, but I wonder if
anim might not be useful in conjunction with profiling the
code to improve performance?

I do performance studies ( modeling, simulation, and measurement)
for Area 59 Operations Systems ( CMS-1, TOPAS, TMAS, FMAS) and
am especially interested in tools which will help developers
understand the performance issues of their code.  If you know
of others who have used anim this way, or if you think anim
may have some useful application here, please let me know.

Thanks.

  I'm in the software group developing the 630 terminal, at Skokie.
Dennis Dugan is my supervisor; you may know him from a class in 
Columbus...
  I saw the article about your "anim" program in the AT&T Technical
Journal.  I'd be interested in getting it running on the 630, initially
as a tool for some demos we're in the process of creating.
  Would you please contact me at your convenience?  I'm also 
interested in hearing what kind of applications you've used it on.

  I called earlier today and left my phone number, so you may 
already have it.  Thanks.
